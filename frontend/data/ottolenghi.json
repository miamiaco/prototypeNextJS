Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Put the torn bread on a large roasting tray and bake for 15 minutes, turning a few times, until dry and crisp. (alternatively, leave the bread out overnight ahead of time and dry at room temperature, or use stale bread).\n2. Meanwhile, put a large, shallow saute pan on a medium-high heat, then add three tablespoons of oil, the onion, celery, garlic, rosemary, apple, 100g of the mushrooms, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, for 15 minutes, until the onion is soft and translucent.\n3. When its time is up, take the bread out of the oven and turn up the temperature to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½. Tip the bread into a large bowl, add the remaining mushrooms, oil, pecans, apricots, lemon zest, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper, and mix to combine.\n4. Pour the brandy into the onion pan, cook for 30 seconds, then stir in the miso and 250ml water and bring to a boil. Cook for another minute, then tip into the bowl. Using a spoon, mix quickly and vigorously to coat then tip the mix back into the pan. Spread it out evenly, with some of the mix poking out here and there, then bake for 25 minutes until nicely charred all over. Remove and leave to rest for at least 10 minutes.\n5. While the stuffing is baking (or reheating), make the green sauce. Put the onion in a small bowl with the lemon juice and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt, toss and leave to sit for five to 10 minutes. Just before serving, stir in the remaining ingredients, season to taste and spoon over the baked stuffing.",

Remove the beans and the paper and continue baking for a further 15 minutes, until the base is a light golden colour.\nFor the filling, put the chocolate and butter together over a pan of hot water and allow to melt (don't let them get too hot). Whisk the eggs and extra yolks with the sugar until thick and pale yellow, then fold the egg mix into the melted chocolate. Spread the jam on the bottom of the pre-baked tart case. Cover with the chocolate filling - it should almost fill the case. Bake for 20 minutes. Leave to cool, then dust with the cocoa powder and place some raspberries on top. Serve at room temperature.",

        "content": "Ingredients\n6 large red peppers\n210g chana dal, washed and soaked in cold water for 30 minutes\n3 tbsp finely chopped\npreserved lemon\nskin\n3 tbsp olive oil\n3 tbsp\nharissa paste\n4 tbsp roughly chopped parsley\n4 tbsp roughly chopped coriander, plus extra to garnish\n2 tsp coriander seeds, toasted and crushed with a pestle and mortar\nCoarse sea salt\n600g cleaned squid, butterflied and cut into 5cm-square pieces\n\nMethod\nUse a small, sharp knife to cut around the stalk of each pepper and lift it out with the seeds attached. Put the peppers on an oven tray, place underneath a very hot grill, as close to the heat as you can get it, and roast, turning every now and then, until they are black on the outside - this should take 25-30 minutes. When ready, remove, cover the tray with foil and leave to cool down slightly. Once you can handle the peppers, remove and discard the blackened skin, then let the peppers cool down further in a bowl, then tear into 3cm wide slices.\nMeanwhile, drain the chana dal from their soaking water, transfer to a medium saucepan, cover with plenty of cold water and bring to a simmer. After about 25 minutes, they should be ready, but check they are tender before draining. Wash under cold water and leave to dry.\nWhen you are ready to assemble the dish, place the dal in a medium nonstick pan together with the pepper slices, some of the pepper juices that will have exuded out into the bowl, the\npreserved lemon\n, half the oil, a third of the\nharissa\n, the parsley and the fresh and dry coriander. Toss gently over medium heat, just to warm up, making sure the peppers don't break down in the process. Taste and season generously with salt.\nMeanwhile, place a ridged griddle pan on the stove top and leave it on maximum heat for about five minutes - it needs to get burning hot. (You can also do this on a barbecue.) Toss the squid with half the olive oil, the remaining harissa and a bit of salt. Spread the squid tentacles and pieces, cut side facing up, in the hot pan and cook quickly to get some grilling marks on one side before turning over. The process shouldn't take more than a minute or two. You will probably need to cook the squid in a few batches, depending on the size of your pan. Just make sure the pieces are spaced well apart.\nTo serve, pile up the dal mix, alternating with the squid pieces, and top the stack with the squid tentacles. Finish off with a trickle of oil and some more chopped coriander.",

Keep the remaining tablespoon or so of melted butter to one side.\n3. Using a small, sharp knife, cut the tops and tails off the lemons, then cut off the skin and pith, working down the fruit’s natural curves. Place a sieve over a small bowl. Working over the bowl, slice in between each membrane to release the lemon segments into the sieve. Squeeze whatever is left of the lemons into the same bowl, to get an extra tablespoon of juice. Put the segments into a separate small bowl.\n4. Put the caster sugar in a small saucepan on a medium-high heat and cook, swirling the pan gently, until it melts and turns to an amber caramel. Take off the heat, add the lemon juice – careful: it will splutter! – a tablespoon of water, a pinch of salt and the thyme sprigs, and whisk until smooth and melted. Add half a teaspoon of the vanilla, then pour the mix over the lemon segments and stir to combine. Heat the grill to its highest setting.

        "title": "Blackberry and star anise friands (SWEET pg 103)",
        "content": "Ingredients\n180g unsalted butter, plus an extra 10g, melted, for brushing\n60g plain flour, plus extra for dusting\n200g icing sugar\n120g ground almonds\n1½ tsp ground star anise (or 3\nwhole star anise\n, blitzed in a spice grinder and passed through a fine-mesh sieve)\n1/8 tsp salt\n150g egg whites (from 4 large eggs)\nfinely grated zest of 1 small orange (1 tsp)\n18 whole blackberries (about 120g), cut in half lengthways\nIcing (optional):\n60g blackberries (about 8), plus an extra 24 small blackberries, to garnish\n¾ tbsp water\n1 tsp lemon juice\n165g icing sugar\n\nMethod\nPreheat the oven to 220°C/200°C Fan/Gas Mark 7. Brush the 12 holes of a regular muffin tin with the melted butter and sprinkle all over with flour. Tap the tray gently to ensure an even coating of the flour, then turn upside down to remove the excess. Place in the fridge to chill while you make the batter.\nTo brown the butter, place in a small saucepan and cook over a medium heat until melted. Continue to cook until the butter is foaming, gently swirling the pan from time to time, to allow the solids to brown more evenly. You will see dark brown sediments begin to form on the sides and bottom of the pan. Continue to allow the butter to bubble away until it turns a rich golden brown and smells of toasted nuts and caramel. Remove the pan from the heat and let it stand for 5 minutes, to allow the burnt solids to collect at the bottom of the pan. Strain through a fine-mesh (or muslin- lined) sieve, discarding the solids. Allow the browned butter to cool slightly before using. It should still be warm when folding into the mix later: if it is too hot, it will ‘cook’ the egg whites; if it is too cool, it will be difficult to incorporate into the mix.\nWhile the butter is cooling, sift the flour, icing sugar, ground almonds, star anise and salt into a bowl. Place the egg whites in a small bowl and use a whisk or fork to froth them up for a few seconds – you do not need to whisk them completely. Pour the egg whites into the sifted dry ingredients and stir until they are incorporated. Add the orange zest and browned butter and mix until the batter is smooth.\nRemove the muffin tin from the fridge and fill the moulds just over two-thirds of the way up the sides. Place three halved blackberries on top, cut side down, and bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 210°C/190°C Fan/Gas Mark 6 – starting with a high oven temperature and then bringing it down is the way to achieve the lovely brown crust you want – turn the tray around in the oven for even cooking, and continue to cook for another 8 minutes, until the edges of the friands are golden brown and the centres have a slight peak and spring back when gently prodded. Set aside to cool before removing them from their moulds: you might need to use a small knife to help you release the sides.\nIf you are icing the cakes, place 60g of blackberries in a small bowl with the water and lemon juice. Use a fork to mash them together, then pass the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to extract as much fruit juice as possible: you should get about 60ml. Sift the icing sugar into a medium bowl, pour in the blackberry juice and combine to make a light purple runny icing: it should just be thick enough to form a thin glaze on the tops of the cakes. Spoon the icing over the cakes, spreading it to the edges so that it runs down the sides. Do this on a rack, if you can, as icing them on a plate or sheet of paper means that the icing will pool at the bottom. Place 2 small blackberries on each friand, set aside for 20 or 30 minutes to set, then serve.",

To make the tahini sauce, whisk together the tahini, lemon juice, garlic, 160ml of water and ¼ teaspoon of salt in a medium bowl. The consistency should be pourable – thick like double cream – so add a bit more water if you need to. Pour this evenly over the lamb and bake, covered, for 20 minutes, until the tahini sauce has thickened. Uncover the pan and bake for another 20 minutes, uncovered, for the tahini crust to turn golden-brown.\n5. Remove from the oven. Let rest for 5 minutes and then serve.",

        "content": "Ingredients\n1kg sweet potatoes, skin on and scrubbed clean\n1 small red onion, thinly sliced into rounds (100g)\n2 tbsp lemon juice\n3 tbsp olive oil\n150g mature cheddar, roughly grated\n3 garlic cloves, crushed\n1 tsp cumin seeds, roughly crushed with a pestle and mortar\n8 medium eggs\n25g unsalted butter\n¾ tbsp sriracha\n2 tbsp picked fresh coriander leaves, with some stem attached\nsalt and black pepper\n\nMethod\n1. Preheat the oven to 200°C fan. Poke the sweet potatoes all over with a fork (about 8–10 times) and place them on a medium, parchment-lined baking tray. Bake for 45–50 minutes, or until cooked through and softened. Set aside to cool and turn the oven temperature down to 180°C fan.\n2. Meanwhile, in a small bowl mix together the onion, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and a pinch of salt and set aside to pickle.\n3. Remove the cooked potato skins and tear them into roughly 4cm pieces. Transfer the potato flesh to a large bowl and set aside. Place the skins back on the baking tray and toss with 1 tablespoon of oil, ¼ teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Bake for 8 minutes, or until nicely coloured and starting to crisp up. Set aside to cool and crisp up further.\n4. Use a fork to mash the potato flesh until smooth, then add the cheddar, garlic, cumin, another tablespoon of oil, the remaining tablespoon of lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of pepper, and mix to combine.\n5. Put the remaining tablespoon of oil into a large frying pan, for which you have a lid, and swirl around to coat the bottom. Spoon the mashed potato mixture into the pan, using your spoon to distribute it evenly. Place on a medium-high heat and leave to cook for about 7 minutes, for the bottom to start to colour. Turn the heat down to medium and use a spoon to make eight wells in the potato mixture, breaking an egg into each. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper, cover with the lid and cook for 4–5 minutes, rotating the pan, or until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny.\n6. While the eggs are cooking, put the butter and sriracha into a small saucepan on a medium heat and cook until the butter has melted, whisking constantly to emulsify. Remove the mixture from the heat before it starts to bubble – you don’t want it to split.\n7. When ready, spoon the sriracha butter all over the eggs, then top with a good handful of the crispy potato skins, half the pickled onion and all the picked coriander leaves. Serve right away, with the rest of the potato skins and pickled onion to eat alongside.",

Heat up the oil in a large saucepan. Add the onion and sage and sauté on medium heat for 5 minutes or until the onion is translucent.\nWhile the onion is cooking, halve the peppers lengthways. Take a half of one pepper, remove the seeds and white flesh and cut it into 1.5cm dice. Keep it for later.\nRemove the seeds from the rest of the peppers, roughly chop them and stir into the saucepan with the onions. Add ¾ a teaspoon of salt, bay leaves, ground cumin, sugar and chilli.\nSauté for another 5 minutes. Add the stock and bring to a light simmer. Cover the pot and cook on a very low heat for 15 minutes.\nOnce the peppers are soft, remove the bay leaves from the soup. While still hot, use a liquidiser or a hand stick blender to pulverise the soup until it is totally smooth. This may take a few minutes. Leave to cool down a little.\nOnce the soup is just warm, stir in the celery, diced red pepper, lemon zest and garlic. Leave until it comes to room temperature and then refrigerate for a few hours or overnight.\nRemove the soup from the fridge half an hour before serving. Stir well, taste and adjust the seasoning. Divide into serving bowls, sprinkle over a generous amount of chopped basil and parsley, add a spoonful of sour cream per portion and finish with a drizzle of olive oil.",

Heat the oven to 180C (170C fan)/375F/ gas 5 and put a rack in the lower third of the oven. Use a little melted butter to grease the base and sides of a 26cm x 4cm tart tin with a removable base. Cut a 42cm x 6cm strip of baking paper and lay it in the base of the tin so it hangs over the edges on each side (you’ll use this to lift out the tart later). In a medium bowl, toss all the filling ingredients.\n2. Put the filo sheets under a slightly damp, clean cloth to stop them drying out, then brush one sheet with some of the melted butter and sprinkle with a teaspoon and a half of sugar. Transfer to the tin, pressing the sheet into the base and sides so it fits snugly; let any excess hang over the sides. Repeat this process with five more sheets of filo, rotating them slightly when you press them into the tin, so the excess hangs out at a different angle.\n3. Fill the filo case evenly with the apple mix, then fold over the excess filo to cover the edges of the tart.\n4 .Take another sheet of filo, brush with melted butter and sprinkle with a teaspoon and a half of sugar. Roughly scrunch it up like a tissue, then arrange on top of the exposed apples. Repeat with the remaining five sheets of filo, to cover the apples, building height as you go.\n5. Put the tin on an oven tray and bake for an hour and 15 minutes, turning once halfway, until well browned and caramelised; if it colours too quickly, turn down the heat to 170C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 halfway through baking. Immediately release and remove the sides of the tin and, using the baking paper “sling”, carefully lift and slide the pastis on to a platter. If serving straight away, pour over the armagnac, dust with icing sugar and serve hot or warm with the creme fraiche alongside.\n6. If you’re making the pastis a day in advance, it can be reheated: unmould back on to the lined baking tray and bake at 190C (180C fan)/390F/ gas 6 for 10-12 minutes. Hold back on the armagnac and icing sugar until you’re ready to serve.",

Put two litres of water in a large saucepan, add three tablespoons of salt and bring to a boil. Add the sweet potatoes, turn down the heat to medium-high and leave to simmer for 20-25 minutes, until tender – a small, sharp knife should go through easily, but you don’t want them mushy or breaking apart. Drain, transfer to a large bowl, add the olive oil and toss gently with your hands so the sweet potatoes are well coated but still hold their shape.\n2. Now make the chive soured cream.

Place the flour, sugar, yeast and zest in a mixer bowl and use the dough hook attachment to stir everything together on low speed for a minute. Add the eggs and water and work for a few seconds on low speed, then increasing to medium and kneading for 3 minutes until the dough comes together. Next, add the salt and start adding the butter, a few cubes at a time, until it all melts into the dough. Continue kneading for about 10 minutes on medium speed until the dough is completely smooth, elastic and shiny. You will need to scrape down the sides of the bowl a few times during the kneading process and throw a small amount of flour on the sides of the bowl so that all dough leaves the sides. Place the dough in a large bowl brushed with sunflower oil, cover with cling film and leave in the fridge for at least half a day, preferably overnight. It will increase in volume but only by 20%-30%.\nPreheat the oven to 170ºC.\nMake a goat’s cheese cream by whisking together the cheese, 10g of the icing sugar, the orange zest, thyme and 1½ of the 2 beaten eggs, until smooth. Stir through the almonds and mix until you get a smooth, thick consistency. Set aside.\nLightly flour a clean work surface and roll the pastry into a 5mm thick square, about 28 x 28 centimetres. Trim the edges so you have an even square. Roll the pastry around a rolling pin to transfer it onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Spread over the goat’s cheese mix, leaving a border of about 1½ centimetre. Brush the remaining egg over the border. Stand the figs on top, slightly overlapping, as they will shrink when cooking. Sprinkle the caster sugar over the figs, cover the tart with foil and set aside to prove in a warm place for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and place the tart in the oven. Bake for about 30 minutes, until the figs are caramelised and the base of the pastry is golden brown.\nWhile the tart is baking make a thin icing by whisking together the remaining icing sugar with the lemon juice. You want a thick yet spreadable icing; add a bit of juice or icing sugar to achieve this. Remove the tart from the oven and use a spoon to drizzle the icing over the figs. Sprinkle with some picked thyme leaves and eat warm or at room temperature.",

        "content": "Ingredients\n200ml vegetable oil, for frying\n1 large aubergine, cut lengthways into 0.5cm thick slices\n2 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into 0.5cm slices\n1 small cauliflower, cut into large florets\n2 medium carrots, cut lengthways into 0.5cm thick slices\n2 large tomatoes, cut into 1cm thick slices\n4 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced\n200g short-grain rice (risotto or paella rice), washed and drained\nFor the liquid:\n400-500ml vegetable stock or water\n½ tsp ground turmeric\n1 tsp paprika\n1 tsp ground nutmeg\n1 tsp\nground cardamom\n1 tsp black pepper\n2 tsp salt\nFor the tahini salad:\n80ml\ntahini\n80ml water\n40ml lemon juice\n1 garlic clove, crushed\n1 tbsp dried mint\n15g flat-leaf parsley, chopped\nSalt, to taste\n4 medium ripe tomatoes, cut roughly into 2cm cubes\n4 mini-cucumbers (or 1 large one, deseeded), skin on, cut roughly into 2cm cubes\nolive oil\n10g mint leaves, roughly chopped\n\nMethod\nPour the oil into a wide frying pan - it should come about 0.5cm up the sides - and place over a high heat. When hot, fry the aubergine in batches for a minute a side, until nicely tanned. Transfer to paper towel. Repeat with the potato and then the cauliflower and carrot, but for only about 30 seconds a side - these vegetables need to take on some colour but stay crunchy.\nCut out a circle of greaseproof paper large enough to cover the base and some of the pan's edge, and line the pan with it. Cover the paper with aubergine slices, then layer up, in order, with the carrots, potatoes, tomatoes and cauliflower. Sprinkle the garlic on top and cover with rice.\nMix the boiling water or stock with the spices and seasoning. Gently pour the mix over the rice, making sure all the rice is immersed. Put the pot on the stove top and bring gently to a boil (you don't want a vigorous simmer because that will ruin the layers). Once simmering, reduce the heat to a bare minimum, cover the pot and cook for 30 minutes. Remove from the heat, lift off the lid, place a clean tea towel over the pan, pop the lid back on and leave to rest for 10-15 minutes.\nWhile you wait for the rice to cook, make the salad. In a bowl, whisk the tahini paste, water, lemon juice, garlic, dried mint and parsley. The mix should be creamy but still runny enough to pour. If it is too thick, add more water. Add salt to taste - be generous. Put the tomato and cucumber chunks in a bowl, pour the dressing on top, mix gently, drizzle with oil and sprinkle with fresh mint. Set aside.\nWhen ready to serve, remove the lid and towel, and place your large serving plate over the pan. Carefully turn over, so the plate is now on the bottom and the pan on top, place on a stable surface and gently lift off the upturned pan. Carefully lift off the greaseproof paper - ideally, you want the rice to keep the pan's shape, though it's not the end of the world if it falls apart. Serve hot or warm with the salad on the side.",

Once hot, add the remaining curry leaves (about 15 leaves) and cook for about a minute, stirring occasionally, until they darken and become translucent. Remove from the heat and set aside.\n4. To serve, stir the fresh coriander and lime juice into the curry and transfer to a large shallow bowl. Alternatively, serve it straight from the pan. Spoon over the tomatoes and any juices released then finish with the tempered curry leaf oil.",

Peel the potatoes, discarding the peel, and cut into irregular shapes, roughly the size of half a lime (4 to 5cm chunks) - the more edges the potatoes have the more space for crisping there will be. Place in a large saucepan and fully submerge in cold water. Add the table salt and a rosemary sprig and bring to the boil on a high heat. Lower to medium-high and cook for 10-15 minutes or until the potatoes are easily pierced with a knife. Drain well through a colander, discard the rosemary sprig and then add back to the dry saucepan and cool slightly for 15 minutes.\n2. Preheat the oven to 220C.\n3. Add the oil to a large 30cm x 40cm roasting tray (or divided between two medium sized tins that will both fit in your oven) and place in the oven to heat up, about 10 minutes. Add the rice flour and gently toss together to coat the potatoes and lightly fluff the edges. Carefully add the potato mixture to the hot oil tray, taking care not to splash the hot oil. Use a spatula to spread them out nicely; they should not be stacked on top of each other. Roast for 30 minutes then, remove from the oven and use a spatula to gently turn them over. Roast for another 25-30 minutes, until deeply golden and crispy.\n4. Make the salsa verde. Start by adding the garlic cloves to a pestle and mortar with a heavy pinch of salt and a good twist of black peper. Bash until the garlic forms a chunk paste, then add the\nza'atar\n, rosemary, thyme and one tablespoon of oil and work into a paste. Next, add the chilli and work into the mix until it has flaked and broken down. Working in stages, mix in the dill and coriander, followed by the mint and then the parsley, each time, adding the remaining oil bit by bit to help incorporate the herbs and work them into the mix. Finally, mix in the vinegar .If making ahead of time, leave the vinegar out and mix it in just before serving to keep it fresh and vibrant.\n5. Meanwhile, pick the leaves from the remaining 2 rosemary sprigs and finely chop them. When the potatoes are ready, remove from the oven and add the chopped rosemary. Gently toss together with a spatula and return to the oven for 3 minutes more, until fragrant. Finally, remove the potatoes and stir in the flaked salt and one tablespoon of za’atar, tossing to evenly coat. Transfer to a large serving platter and sprinkle over the remaining za’atar.",

Preheat the oven to 200°C fan.\n2. Start making the filling. Put the honey, vanilla seeds and pod, bay leaves, cinnamon stick, ground cinnamon and salt into a large ovenproof sauté pan on a medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5–6 minutes, stirring often, until the honey is deeply brown (don’t be afraid to take it to the edge; you want it to be very dark). Off the heat, whisk in the orange juice. Gently pour 65g of the burnt honey into a heatproof bowl. Pick out the bay leaves and vanilla pod and add them to the bowl.\n3. Stir the apples and olive oil into the sauté pan with the remaining burnt honey, then transfer to the oven for 20 minutes, stirring halfway through, until the apples have softened and caramelised but still retain their shape. Set aside to cool completely. Pick out the cinnamon stick and add it to the reserved burnt honey bowl. Keep the oven on.\n4. Make the roulade. Line a large 40cm x 30cm baking tray with baking parchment.\n5. Put the egg whites into the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment in place and beat on medium-high speed for 1 minute, until soft peaks form. Combine both sugars in a bowl and gradually add this to the mixer, a tablespoon at a time, whisking continuously on high speed for 5 minutes, until the mixture is a thick glossy meringue. Reduce the speed to low and add the vanilla paste, cinnamon, vinegar and cornflour. Turn the speed to medium and whisk for a minute, to fully combine.\n6. Spoon the meringue on to the prepared tray and use a spatula to spread it out evenly so it’s about 35cm x 25cm. Transfer to the oven and immediately turn the heat down to 180°C fan. Bake for 30–32 minutes, until the meringue is crusty on top and lightly brown. Set aside to deflate and cool completely.\n7. Meanwhile, prepare the cream by putting the whipping cream, icing sugar and mascarpone into the cleaned bowl of the stand mixer with the whisk attachment in place. Beat on medium speed for 1–2 minutes, until soft peaks form. Stir in the orange zest.\n8. Place a clean tea towel on top of the cooled meringue and quickly invert the whole thing on to a work surface. Lift the tin off and peel away the lining. Spread three-quarters of the cream evenly all over the meringue. Top evenly with the burnt honey apples (reserving any liquid released from the apples for another use).\n9. Starting with the longest side closest to you and using the tea towel to assist you, roll the meringue up and over, so that the edges come together to form a log. Gently pull away the tea towel as you roll, then slide the meringue on to a long tray or platter, seam side down. Use a serrated knife to trim off 2cm from the sides to create neat edges (nibble on these if you like!). Refrigerate to firm up, at least 30 minutes (and up to 3 hours if you’re getting ahead).\n10. To serve, spoon the remaining cream down the length of the roulade. Top artfully with the bay leaves, vanilla pod halves and cinnamon stick. Drizzle with the reserved burnt honey syrup and sprinkle with the extra zest.",

Once boiling, turn down the heat to medium and leave to simmer for seven to eight minutes, to infuse and reduce a little. Strain into a large jug (the aromatics can now be discarded): you should have about 950ml of flavoured stock.\n2. Melt the butter and oil in a large saute pan on a medium-high flame, then add the carrots (in batches, if need be: you don’t want to overcrowd the pan) and half a teaspoon of flaked salt. Saute for five to six minutes, turning the carrots over every couple of minutes or so, until browned on all sides. Transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon, then add the leeks and half a teaspoon of flaked salt to the pan, and saute for four to five minutes, turning them over gently every two minutes but not stirring, otherwise they’ll break up. When the leeks are browned all over, return the carrots to the pan and pour over 200ml of the infused stock. Cook for a couple of minutes on a medium-high heat, until reduced by two-thirds, then add another 200ml stock and repeat the reduction process. Repeat until all the liquid has been added to the pan and the vegetables are tender: this stage should take about 15 minutes in total.\n3. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked vegetables to a medium bowl and leave the remaining stock on medium-high heat for about 10 minutes, until it’s reduced down to about 70ml. Pour this over the vegetables and leave to cool.\n4. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the vegetables to a large plate (discard any remaining stock), dot with the cheese and sprinkle over the dill and tarragon. Sprinkle over a quarter-teaspoon of flaked salt and a good grind of pepper, drizzle over a final teaspoon of oil and serve at room temperature.",

Place the pecans in a medium bowl and drop the balls into the nuts as you form them, rolling them around so that they are completely coated and pressing the nuts in so that they stick.\nLine a baking tray with baking parchment, place the cookies on the tray – there is no need to space them apart at this stage – and transfer to the fridge for at least an hour.\nWhen ready to bake, preheat the oven to 190°C/170°C Fan/Gas Mark 5. Line two baking trays with baking parchment.\nPlace the icing sugar in a bowl and roll the cookies in the icing sugar, pressing it in as you go so that it sticks well. Place on the lined baking trays, spaced 2–3cm apart, and flatten the cookies to 1cm thick.\nBake for 10 minutes. They will be soft to the touch when they come out of the oven, so allow them to cool on the tray for 10 minutes before gently transferring to a wire rack. These can be served warm, when they will be a little gooey in the centre, or set aside until completely cool.",

        "content": "Ingredients\n1 medium goose (5-6kg), with giblets\n2 bay leaves (preferably fresh)\n2 carrots, roughly chopped\n2 onions, roughly chopped\n3 celery sticks, roughly chopped\n3 lemons, halved\n3 medium onions, peeled and halved\nMaldon sea salt and black pepper\n2 large quinces (about 500g each)\n300ml water\n70g caster sugar\n1 lemon, juiced\n2 cinnamon sticks\n3 bay leaves\n500ml chicken stock\n1 tbsp\nmaple syrup\n350g fresh (or frozen) cranberries\nFresh herbs, to serve\n\nMethod\nPreheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Put the giblets in a medium pan with bay leaves, carrots, onions and celery. Cover with water, bring to a boil and simmer for a couple of hours.\nIf the goose is trussed, remove the string and free up the legs and wings. Prick the skin all over to assist the melting down of the fat. Trim off any visible excess fat, especially in the neck area. Put the lemon and onion halves in the cavity. Place the goose, breast side down, on a wire rack over a large roasting tin. Cover with foil, leaving the base uncovered to allow the fat to run out. You will need to drain the fat regularly during the cooking, every half-hour or so, or it will burn. To this end, have ready a large, heatproof bowl with a sieve over it. By the end of the cooking, you'll have a substantial amount of pure goose fat for roasting potatoes and other vegetables. Also, line the bottom of the oven with foil to protect it.\nOnce all the preparations are done, put the goose tin in the top part of the oven. After 30 minutes, lower the heat to 180C/350F/gas mark 4, roast for another hour, then remove the foil and turn the goose over so its breast faces up. Cover again and roast for another 75 minutes. Drain the fat occasionally throughout.\nFor the final cooking stage, remove the foil (but keep it handy), sprinkle the goose with lots of salt and pepper, and roast, breast up, for 45 minutes longer. Baste the breast from time to time with hot fat. To check that the goose is cooked, pierce the thickest part of the thigh with a skewer - the juices should come out clear.\nWhen done, remove the bird from the oven, cover it loosely with the reserved foil and leave to rest for 20 minutes before carving.\nThe moment the goose goes into the oven, start preparing the quince. Peel the fruit but keep the skin. Cut each in two vertically and then every half into three. Remove the core, and put the segments and peel in an oven tray. Add the water, half the sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon sticks and bay leaves, cover with foil and bake under the goose for two hours, by which time the quince should be tender. Discard the peel and set aside the tray, covered, until needed.\nFor the gravy, pass the giblet stock through a fine sieve into a medium pan. Add the chicken stock and place on medium heat. Bring to a boil, then simmer to reduce to a light gravy consistency, about 20 minutes. Add the syrup and season to taste.\nJust before serving, prepare the cranberries. Put a big frying pan on a high heat. Add the cranberries and remaining sugar, stir, then cook, shaking the pan regularly, until the fruit is soft, three minutes or so. Add the quince to the pan and keep warm.\nLine a serving platter with lots of fresh herbs, place the goose in the middle and pour the quince and cranberries over the top. Serve with the hot gravy on the side.\nWhen carving, pull out the legs and cut through the joint to remove. Slice the meat parallel to the bone. Next, cut 1cm thick slices from the breast, and finally, use your hands and a small knife to shave off all the other hidden bits (there will be lots).",

Heat the oven to 165C/145C fan/330F/ gas 3. Line a 20cm square baking tin that has a removable base with a piece of baking paper large enough to cover the base and sides.\n2. For the crust, add the flour, icing sugar, salt, lemon zest, thyme and butter to a food processor and pulse a few times to a crumbly meal – about 20 seconds. Add the almonds and blitz for a few seconds more, until roughly broken. Transfer to the baking tin and use your hands to press the crust into an even layer to cover the base. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until golden, then set aside until needed.\n3. Meanwhile, make the filling. Whisk together the eggs, yolks, sugar, salt, and lemon zest and juice, in a medium saucepan until smooth. Put over a medium-low heat and stir continuously, until the mixture resembles a thick custard – 12-15 minutes.\n4. Meanwhile, place the butter in a medium bowl and place a fine meshed sieve over the bowl.\n5. Remove the lemony custard from the heat and strain through the sieve onto the butter, using a spatula or spoon to push the custard through (discard any sediment that is left in the sieve). Stir until melted and combined. Pour over the shortbread crust and gently shake the tin to even out. Top with the raspberries, spreading them out, cut side down, pressing them in gently without completely submerging them.\n6. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until set but still slightly jiggly in the centre. Leave to cool at room temperature for an hour before refrigerating for at least four hours to set completely.\n7. Gently remove the lemon bar from the tin by holding the baking paper on both sides, and lift on to a cutting board. Trim the ends to give you a perfect square, then slice into 15 pieces, wiping the knife clean as you go.\n8. Use a small sieve to dust the top with icing sugar, then sprinkle with the extra thyme. Serve at once: these are best eaten cold, not long after they’ve been dusted with sugar.",

Roll out the pastry 2-3mm thick and line the base neatly, allowing the pastry to spill over the edge by at least 2cm. This excess will be trimmed later. Score the base with a fork in a few places. Rest the tart case in the fridge for at least half an hour.\nHeat the oven to 170ºC/ Gas Mark 3. Cut a circle of greaseproof paper greater in diameter than the base plus the sides of the tart case. Tuck it inside the tart case and fill up with dried beans or rice. Bake the case blind for 35 minutes, take the beans out (keep for similar use in the future) and cook for further 5-10 minutes, until light golden and thoroughly cooked. Remove from the oven and leave to cool.\nAlongside the baking case you can also toast the pine nuts. Scatter them on a separate tray and leave in the oven for 8 minutes or until they go golden.\nTo make the filling, heat up half the olive oil in a large heavy saucepan. Add the beef, break it down with a fork and cook it on a high flame for a few minutes to get some colour. Add the pork meat, mix well with your fork and keep on cooking on medium heat for 15 minutes or until golden. Stir in the tomato purée and sugar and cook for another 3 minutes. Add salt, pepper, mint and all the spices. Cook for a further 10 minutes over low heat.\nIn the meantime, fry the onions in a separate pan with the remaining olive oil until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Drain out most of the oil and add the onion to the cooked meat. Also add the pine nuts and taste for salt and pepper.\nHeat the oven to 190ºC/Gas mark 5. To assemble the tart, spoon half of the hot meat mix into the pastry case. Make some shallow holes in the mixture, break 3 eggs, one by on, and pour them into the holes. Using a wooden spoon, stir the eggs gently in the meat – just enough to disperse them a little, while keeping areas with more egg and maintaining some distinction between white and yolk. Spoon the rest of the meat on top, create some gaps and holes in it and break in the rest of the eggs dispersing them as before.\nPut the pie in the oven for about 15 minutes or until the eggs are set. If the top begins to darken cover it with foil for the remaining cooking period.\nOnce ready, remove from the oven, break off the excess pastry with your hands and take the pie out of its tine. Serve hot or warm, garnished with parsley.",

Cook on medium heat for 20 minutes, turning occasionally with metal tongs until the outside is totally burnt and the aubergine starts to collapse on itself. Alternatively, place the pierced aubergines on a tin foil lined tray under a hot grill in the oven for an hour, turning every 20 minutes. Remove from and place in a colander. Cut a single slit in each aubergine, from top to bottom and allow the juices to strain. Once cool enough to handle, scoop out all the flesh, avoiding all black skin, and set aside. You should have about 370g aubergine flesh.\nPrepare the\ntahini\nsauce by simply whisking together all the ingredients with ¼ teaspoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of water. It needs to be thick and rich, but you may need to add a splash of water if it is stiff. Next heat up the olive oil in a medium, heavy-based frying pan. Add the onion, garlic, chilli, cinnamon and cumin and tomato paste and sauté on a medium–high heat for 6 minutes to soften and colour a bit. Add the minced beef, 1 teaspoon of salt and some black pepper and brown well, 5–6 minutes, stirring, on high heat.\nMix in the tomatoes,\npreserved lemon\nand aubergine flesh and cook for a further 5 minutes. Add up to 90ml of water if the sauce is becoming very thick. Make 4 small wells in the mix and break an egg into each. Cook the eggs on low heat for about 10 minutes, until the egg whites are cooked but the yolks are still runny. Covering the pan with a lid will hasten the process but make the yolks look a bit cloudy. Remove from the heat and dot with dollops of tahini sauce, sprinkle with\nsumac\nand finish with the parsley and a drizzle of olive oil. Serve at once.",

Once hot, add the capers and fry for about a minute, until the capers have opened out and are crispy. Use a slotted spoon to remove from the oil and set aside on a kitchen paper-lined plate.\nWhen you are ready to serve, spoon about 2 tablespoons of the cauliflower and tahini mash onto each plate (if you have made it) and spread out into a thin layer, not much larger than the cauliflower steaks. Place the cauliflower steaks on top and then spoon over the onion and zahter (or oregano) salsa. Finish with a sprinkle of the crispy capers, along with the coriander, and serve.",

Put the yeast, sugar and a tablespoon and a half of warm water in a small bowl, stir to combine and set aside for five minutes, until it starts to bubble. Put the flour, yoghurt, oil and one beaten egg in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, mix well, then add the carom seeds, half the nigella seeds and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt, and mix on a medium-high speed for two minutes, until just combined. Add the contents of the yeast bowl and mix for for five minutes, until the dough turns smooth and starts to come away from the sides of the bowl in one ball. Cover tightly, ideally with reusable kitchen wrap, then leave in a warm place to prove for an hour and a half, until doubled in size.\n2. Meanwhile, mix the cream cheese and mozzarella in a small bowl with the cracked black pepper, then divide into four equal pieces, roll each into a ball, put on a plate and chill in the fridge.\n3. Heat the oven to 230C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9, and put a large baking tray on the middle rack to heat up.\n4. Once the dough has doubled in size, scrape it on to a lightly floured work surface and knead to knock out the air and bring it together into a smooth ball. Divide the dough into four equal-sized balls, then roll out each one into a 22cm x 17cm oval. Brush the tops all over with the other beaten egg, then roll over the edges of the longer sides of each oval to make a cigar-like shape with an 8cm gap in the middle. Pinch together the ends, so each piece now looks a bit like a boat, then place one cheese ball in the exposed middle of each boat. Brush the exposed edges of the dough all over with the remaining beaten egg, then carefully lift each khachapuri on to the hot tray in the oven and bake for 13 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling and the bread golden brown.\n5. Remove the tray from the oven, then flatten the hot cheese balls with the back of a spoon. Crack an egg on top of each flattened cheese ball, top each egg with a pinch of salt and return to the oven for five minutes, until the egg white is set but the yolk still runny.\n6. Meanwhile, make the chilli and spring onion butter. Put a small saucepan on a medium-high heat, add the butter and, once it’s bubbling furiously, stir in the aleppo chilli. Take off the heat and stir in the spring onions and a pinch of salt.\n7. Arrange the khachapuri on a large platter and sprinkle over the remaining quarter-teaspoon of nigella seeds. Spoon a tablespoon of the hot butter mix on top of each bread, and serve with the rest on the side for dipping.",

Grease and line a 23cm square or 30 x 20cm rectangular baking tin with baking parchment and set aside.\n2. Place the butter and chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure that the base of the bowl is not touching the water. Leave for about 2 minutes, to melt, then remove the bowl from the heat. Stir through, until you have a thick shiny sauce, and set aside to come to room temperature.\n3. Place the eggs and sugar in a large bowl and whisk until pale and creamy and a trail is left behind when you move the whisk: this will take about 3 minutes with an electric mixer, longer by hand. Add the chocolate and fold through gently using a spatula – don’t over-work the mix here.\n4. Sift the flour, cocoa and salt into a bowl, then gently fold into the chocolate mixture. Finally, add the pieces of halva, gently fold through the mix, then pour or scrape the mixture into the lined baking tin, using a small spatula to even it out.\nDollop small spoonfuls of the tahini paste into the mix in about 12 different places, then use a skewer to swirl them through to create a marbled effect, taking the marbling right to the edges of the tin.\n6. Bake for about 23 minutes, until the middle has a slight wobble and it is gooey inside – they may be ready anywhere between 22 and 25 minutes. If using the 30 x 20cm tin, they will need a couple of minutes less. They may seem a little under-cooked at first, but they firm up once they start to cool down. If you want to serve them warm-ish (and gooey), set aside for just 30 minutes before cutting into 16 pieces. Otherwise, set aside for longer to cool to room temperature.",

Put the first eight ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook in place. Knead on a medium-high speed for seven minutes, or until the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl (it will be quite sticky), then transfer to a lightly greased bowl. Cover with a damp cloth and leave to rise in a warm place for about an hour and a half, until soft, pillowy and doubled in size.\n2. Meanwhile, whisk all the glaze ingredients in a medium bowl, until well combined and smooth.\n3. Lightly flour your hands and a clean work surface, then tip out the dough on to it. Punch down to release the air, then use a sharp knife to cut the dough into eight equal pieces (about 45g each). Clean and dry the work surface, then grease with a little olive oil. With lightly greased hands, shape each piece of dough into a smooth, round ball. Transfer to a tray lined with greaseproof paper, spacing them well apart, then leave to prove again, uncovered, for 20 minutes, or until the dough springs back slowly when touched.\n4. Heat the sunflower oil in a medium saucepan on a medium flame until it reaches 180C. Line a tray with plenty of kitchen paper. Once the oil is hot, use your hands very lightly to flatten each round of dough so it’s got two sides but without squeezing out much of the air. In batches of three, carefully lower the doughnuts into the hot oil and fry for two to two and a half minutes on each side, until golden brown and cooked through. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cooked doughnuts to the lined tray and repeat with the remaining balls of dough.\n5.

Discard the seeds and remaining pulp; you should be left with about 160ml of tamarind liquid.\n2. Add 3 tablespoons of oil to a large sauté pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 7 minutes or until softened and lightly browned. Add the garlic and finely chopped green chilli and cook for 1 minute more then turn the heat down to medium low. Stir in the spring onion, coriander and parsley and cook for 20 minutes on medium low, stirring often, until the herbs are a deep green, but not brown. Add the flour, spices, 1 teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of pepper and cook for about 30 seconds before adding the tamarind liquid, sugar and 500 millilitres of water. Simmer for 10 minutes for the sauce to thicken and come together.\n3. While the stew is cooking, place a large frying pan on a high heat. In a bowl, toss the prawns with 1 tablespoon oil, ¼ teaspoon salt and a good grind of pepper. Once very hot, add a third of the prawns to the pan and fry for 1-1½ minutes on each side, until nicely browned. Transfer to a plate and continue in this way with the rest of the prawns. Let the pan cool slightly then return to a medium-high heat with the butter, garlic, turmeric and chilli. Cook for about a minute, until fragrant then add back the prawns and the coriander and toss to coat, about another 30 seconds. Remove from the heat and squeeze over the lemon half.\n4. Stir half the prawns through the stew and transfer to a large shallow bowl. Top with the remaining prawns and the sliced green chillies.",

        "content": "Ingredients\n750g chestnut mushrooms, halved\n500g oyster mushrooms\n135ml olive oil, plus extra for greasing\n60g dried porcini mushrooms\n30g dried wild mushrooms\n2 dried red chillies, roughly chopped (deseeded for less heat)\n500ml hot vegetable stock\n1 onion, peeled and quartered\n5 garlic cloves, roughly chopped\n1 carrot, peeled and quartered (90g)\n2–3 plum tomatoes, quartered (200g)\n75g tomato paste\n130ml double cream\n60g Pecorino Romano, finely grated\n60g Parmesan, finely grated\n5g basil leaves, finely chopped\n10g parsley leaves, finely chopped, plus an extra tsp to serve\n250g dried lasagne sheets (that’s about 14 sheets)\nsalt and black pepper\n\nMethod\n1. Preheat the oven to 230°C fan.\n2. Put the chestnut and oyster mushrooms into the large bowl of a food processor in three or four batches and pulse each batch until finely chopped (or finely chop everything by hand). Toss the chopped mushrooms in a large bowl with 3 tablespoons of oil and 1 teaspoon of salt and spread out on a large, 40cm x 35cm parchment-lined, rimmed baking tray. Bake for 30 minutes near the top of the oven, stirring three times throughout, until the mushrooms are golden-brown; they will have reduced in volume significantly. Set aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 200°C fan.\n3. Meanwhile, combine the dried mushrooms, chillies and hot stock in a large bowl and set aside to soak for half an hour. Strain the liquid into another bowl, squeezing as much liquid from the mushrooms as possible to get about 340ml: if you have any less, top up with water. Very roughly chop the rehydrated mushrooms (you want some chunks) and finely chop the chillies. Set the stock and mushrooms aside separately.\n4. Put the onion, garlic and carrot into the food processor and pulse until finely chopped (or finely chop everything by hand). Heat 60ml of oil in a large sauté pan or pot on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onion mixture and fry for 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden. Pulse the tomatoes in the food processor until finely chopped (or finely chop by hand), then add to the pan along with the tomato paste, 1½ teaspoons of salt and 1¾ teaspoons of freshly cracked black pepper. Cook for 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the rehydrated mushrooms and chillies and the roasted mushrooms and cook for 9 minutes, resisting the urge to stir: you want the mushrooms to be slightly crisp and browned on the bottom. Stir in the reserved stock and 800ml of water and, once simmering, reduce the heat to medium and cook for about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until you get the consistency of a ragù. Stir in 100ml of the cream and simmer for another 2 minutes, then remove from the heat.\n5. Combine both cheeses and both herbs in a small bowl. To assemble the lasagne, spread one-fifth of the sauce in the bottom of a round 28cm baking dish (or a 30cm x 20cm rectangular dish), then top with a fifth of the cheese mixture, followed by a layer of lasagne sheets, broken to fit where necessary. Repeat these layers three more times in that order, and finish with a final layer of sauce and cheese: that’s five layers of sauce and cheese and four layers of pasta.\n6. Drizzle over 1 tablespoon of cream and 1 tablespoon of oil, then cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes. Remove the foil, increase the temperature to 220°C fan and bake for another 12 minutes, turning the dish round halfway. Turn the oven to the grill setting and grill for a final 2 minutes, until the edges are brown and crisp. Set aside to cool for 5 or so minutes, then drizzle over the remaining tablespoon of cream and oil. Sprinkle over the remaining parsley, finish with a good grind of pepper and serve.",

Massage the onions for a minute, until the liquid turns pink, then leave to pickle for at least two hours: the longer you leave them, the brighter and pinker they become.\nHeat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7.

Roast for 20 minutes, until crisp and golden-brown, then toss in any oil left on the tray and leave to cool.\nWhile the sweet potatoes are cooking, blitz the coriander, grated lime zest, the remaining three tablespoons of oil and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt to a smooth, bright green salsa. I use a spice grinder to do this (don't use a food processor, the quantities involved are too small); if you don't have one, very finely chop the coriander and mix the salsa by hand.\nOnce the sweet potatoes have cooled, arrange them on a platter and dot evenly with the pieces of cheese. Drain the pickled onions, discarding the lime peel, and scatter on top. Finish with a drizzle of salsa and a sprinkle of almonds.",

Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. First, make the filo wafer, keeping the filo sheets under a damp cloth so they don’t dry out. Lay out one sheet of filo on a clean, dry worktop and brush all over with a third of the butter. Sprinkle over a third of a teaspoon of cinnamon, a quarter-teaspoon of flaked salt and two teaspoons of sugar. Lay another sheet of filo on top of the first sheet, and repeat the brushing and sprinkling process twice more to use up three sheet of filo, all the remaining butter, cinnamon and salt and all but two teaspoons of the sugar. Lay the fourth and final sheet of filo on top, then brush all over with the beaten egg white – you will need only about two-thirds of it to cover. Sprinkle over the remaining two teaspoons of sugar and transfer to a large baking tray lined with greaseproof paper. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until deeply golden, then remove and leave to cool completely. Once cool, break into random, bite-sized shards.\n2. While the filo is baking, make the yoghurt cream. Put the cream, sugar and vanilla in a large bowl and whisk to barely soft peaks (take care not to over-whisk it, because the cream will thicken slightly when it’s chilled). With a spatula, gently fold in the yoghurt and cardamom, then refrigerate until nice and cold.\n3. Now make the sticky apricots. Put the honey, sugar and salt in a small, nonstick frying pan set over a medium-high heat and cook, stirring occasionally, for four minutes, until the mixture is bubbling and starting to brown. Add the cardamom pods and lemon strips, and cook for 90 seconds more, until very fragrant and nicely coloured. Take off the heat, then immediately stir in the apricots, lemon juice, orange blossom water and two tablespoons of cold water, then set aside to cool completely (the syrup will thicken as it sits).\n4. Divide the cold yoghurt cream between four small bowls, top with the some of the sticky apricots and a shard of filo wafer, and serve with extra filo wafers in bowls alongside.",

For the marinated prawns, twist off the prawn heads and put them in a bowl. Leaving the tails intact, peel and discard the prawn shells, then de-vein the prawns and use a small, sharp knife to open them up so they are semi-butterflied. Put the prawns in a medium bowl with the paprika, half the garlic, two tablespoons of oil and a quarter-teaspoon of salt. Mix together and leave to marinate for 20 or minutes.\n2. Meanwhile, heat three tablespoons of oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan on a medium flame, then fry the prawn heads, stirring, for about five minutes, until crisp and bright pink. Use a potato masher (or metal whisk) to crush the heads and release their liquids and flavour into the oil. Strain through a fine sieve, reserving the oil, and discard the heads.\n3. Return the oil to the pan and put on a medium-high heat. Add another tablespoon of oil and the remaining garlic, and fry for a minute, stirring, until lightly coloured.

Scrape the prawn marinade into the pan with the reserved fish, and warm up.\n7. Transfer the pirão to a large, shallow bowl and top with the prawns and fish. Toss the remaining coriander with the marinated green chillies, and spoon over the top. Squeeze the lime and drizzle the remaining two tablespoons of oil over, and serve.",

Pour 2 tablespoons of the olive oil into a large pot. Heat up the oil and add the onion, celery and carrot. Sauté on a medium heat for about 5 minutes; you want to soften up the vegetables without browning them. Next, add the thyme, bay leaves and parsley and cover with 1.2 litres of water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat, cover and simmer gently for 30 minutes.\nWhile the stock is cooking, get on with the arduous bit – preparing the broad beans. Bring a saucepan of water to the boil. Throw in the beans and simmer for just 1 minute. Drain, then refresh the beans under running cold water to stop the cooking. Next, remove the skins by gently pressing with your fingers against the sides of each bean, causing the soft bean to pop out; discard the skins.\nWhen the stock is ready, pass it through a sieve into a medium saucepan; discard the vegetables and flavourings in the sieve. Add the rice to the stock. Bring to the boil, then simmer, covered, for 20 minutes. Now add half the skinned broad beans and some salt and pepper and use a stick blender (or a regular blender) to blitz the soup until it is completely smooth.\nWhisk together the yoghurt, garlic and egg in a large heatproof bowl. Add a ladleful of the hot soup and whisk together. Continue gradually adding the soup until you’ve mixed in at least half of it. (It is important to do this slowly, otherwise the yoghurt might split due to the difference in temperatures.)\nPour the tempered yoghurt into the pan containing the rest of the soup. Place it on a medium heat and warm up the soup while stirring constantly. Make sure the soup doesn’t boil! Taste and add more salt and pepper, if you like.\nLadle the soup into four shallow bowls and drop in the remaining broad beans. Garnish generously with dill, chervil and lemon zest, and drizzle with the remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil (this is important), plus some lemon juice, if you like.",

Put the chicken breast side up in a large stock pot for which you have a lid, and add the ginger, garlic, chilli, onion, halved spring onions, coriander stalks, whole spices, two teaspoons of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Pour over 2.5 litres water and bring to a boil on a medium-high heat. Turn down the heat to medium-low, cover with a lid and leave to simmer gently for 80 minutes, or until the chicken is very tender. Lift out the chicken and set it to one side. Strain the broth into a large container or bowl, discard the solids, then pour the broth back into the stock pot.\n2. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Carefully remove the skin from the breast, legs and back of the chicken – try to lift it off in largish pieces – then, using a butter knife, gently scrape off any fat or sinew that might be attached to the underside of each piece of skin (don’t worry if you can’t get it all off). Pat dry the skin, lay it skin-side down on a large oven tray lined with greaseproof paper and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover with another piece of greaseproof paper and a tray of similar size, to weigh it down, then roast for 20 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Remove the top tray and paper and leave to cool for five to 10 minutes, during which time it will crisp up further.\n3. Meanwhile, use your hands to pull apart the chicken meat into large shreds, discarding the bones and cartilage as you go. Stir the meat back into the strained stock and bring to a simmer on a medium-high heat. Add the cabbage and simmer for about three minutes, until cooked through but still with a slight bite. Off the heat, stir in the fish sauce and lime juice. Combine the sesame seeds and chilli flakes in a small bowl.\n4. To serve, divide the soup between six bowls and top with the sliced spring onion and picked coriander. Drizzle each bowl with half a teaspoon of sesame oil, then spoon over the sesame seed mixture. Break the chicken skin into random pieces and divide between the bowls, and serve with the lime wedges alongside.",

Line a 22cm cake tin with greaseproof paper. In a mixer, cream the butter, sugar, salt and lemon zest until light. Slowly add the eggs and then fold in the flour. Pour into the cake tin, level with a spatula and bake for about 30 minutes. To check if it's done, insert a skewer - it should come out clean. Remove from the oven. Cool.\nIn the meantime, pour the sugar into a saucepan, add 3 tbsp of water and place over a medium heat. Bring to the boil and allow to bubble, occasionally brushing the inside of the pan with cold water, just above the bubbling syrup (this prevents the sugar from crystallising). Keep a close eye on it until you get a semi-dark caramel colour, then remove from the heat and, keeping your face at a safe distance from the pan (the syrup may spit), pour in the cherries and vanilla seeds. Mix with a wooden spoon and return to the heat. Simmer for about 8 minutes or until the cherries are soft. Remove from the heat, allow to cool, then strain, keeping the fruit and liquid separate. Now make the soaking syrup by mixing 100ml of your cherry poaching liquids with the grappa and 30ml water.\nWhisk together all the cream ingredients until they begin to thicken, then take the cake out of the tin and carefully cut it into 2-3 thin discs.\nTo assemble the trifle, place one sponge disc on the bottom of a 2.5l glass bowl (you might need to trim it to fit). Brush the sponge with the syrup using a pastry brush, making sure it's well soaked. Then spread a generous layer of cream on top and cover with the cherries. Repeat the process once or twice more, finishing with a layer of cream. Scatter over the meringue pieces and garnish in the centre with the whole cherries. Chill, then serve with a dollop of creme fraiche on the side.",

Start with the pickle. Bring a small saucepan of water to the boil on a medium-high heat. Add the mustard seeds and blanch for 30 seconds. Drain in a sieve, then fill the pan with fresh water again and repeat this process twice more. This’ll remove any bitterness from the seeds.\n2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the vinegar, sugar and 1⁄4 teaspoon of salt to dissolve, then add the mustard seeds and cucumber and toss to combine. Set aside to pickle lightly while you continue with the recipe.\n3. Peel the potatoes and grate them on the coarse side of a box grater. Transfer half the mixture to a clean tea towel and wring out as much liquid as you can. Don’t worry about being too forceful; a little liquid will help it cook through. Transfer to a large bowl and repeat with the remaining grated potato. You should have roughly 600g wrung-out potato. Add the panko, the 2 tablespoons of melted ghee, 11⁄4 teaspoons of salt and a good grind of pepper and mix well to combine.\n4. Place a large, non-stick frying pan over a medium heat with 40g of the ghee. Once the ghee is melted and hot but not smoking, add the potato mixture, using the back of a spatula to smooth it out evenly. Let it cook and brown gently for 25–30 minutes. Towards the last 5–10 minutes, the rösti will start to detach from the base of the pan and you’ll be able to move it around easily. Carefully invert the rösti on to a large plate, browned side up. Return the pan to a medium heat with the remaining 15g of ghee and, once melted, slide the rösti back into the pan, browned side up. Cook for another 15 minutes, until nicely browned on the bottom. Transfer to a board and cut the rösti into eight equal pieces.\n5. Once the rösti has been flipped, add the red onion to the pickle mixture to soften slightly. Stir through the dill right before serving.\n6. Make the cream cheese by stirring it together in a bowl with the spring onions and a tiny pinch of salt.\n7. Make the everything seasoning by mixing all the ingredients together in a bowl.\n8. Divide the rösti between four plates, with a spoonful each of the cream cheese and pickle mixture and a good sprinkling of everything seasoning, serving any extra alongside.",

Put all the ingredients, apart from the tomatoes, in a bowl. Cut the tomatoes in half, coarsely grate into the bowl and discard the skins. Add half a teaspoon of salt and some black pepper, and stir. Leave on the side, or in the fridge, for up to a day. Before using, gently squeeze with your hands and drain away any juices that come out.\nTo make the sauce, heat the oil in a medium pan. Add the ginger and garlic, cook for a minute or two, taking care not to burn them, then add the tomato, lemon juice and sugar. Season, and simmer for 20 minutes.\nWhile the sauce is bubbling away, prepare the vine leaves. Use any torn or broken leaves to line the base of a wide, heavy saucepan. Trim any leaves from the fennel, cut it vertically into 0.5cm-thick slices and spread over the base of the pan to cover completely.\nLay a prepared vine leaf (see intro) on a work surface, veiny side up. Put two teaspoons of filling at the base of the leaf in a 2cm-long by 1cm-wide strip. Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll it tightly from bottom to top, in a cigar shape. Place in the pan, seam down, and repeat with the remaining leaves, placing them tightly next to each other in lines or circles (in two layers if necessary).\nPour the sauce over the leaves (and, if needed, add water just to cover). Place a plate on top, to weigh the leaves down, then cover with a lid. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and cook on a bare simmer for 70 minutes. Most of the liquid should evaporate. Remove from the heat, and leave to cool a little - they are best served warm. When serving, bring to the table in the pan - it looks great. Serve a few vine leaves and fennel slices with warm rice. Spoon the braising juices on top and garnish with coriander.",

Turn the heat off and leave the couscous to sit, covered, for another 10 minutes.\n2. While the couscous is cooking, finely grate the lemon to give you 2 teaspoons of zest and place in a small bowl. Using a small, sharp knife, trim the tops and tails off the zested lemon. Cut down along its round curves, removing the skin and white pith. Release the segments from the lemon by slicing between the membranes and then cut each segment into rough chunks and add them to the zest. Squeeze any remaining juice from what’s left of the lemon into the same bowl, about a teaspoon.\n3. After the couscous has rested for 10 minutes, remove the lid. Stir in the lemon zest, flesh, juice and the oil and leave to cool.\n4. Place the raisins in a bowl, cover with about 50 millilitres boiling water and set aside to soak for 10 minutes before draining well. Add the raisins, cumin, almonds, herbs, ¼ teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper to the couscous.\n5.

First make the batter. Put the flour, baking powder and sugar in a medium bowl and whisk to combine. Add the eggs, honey, mirin and vanilla, and whisk until smooth, thick and glossy. Cover with a plate and set aside for 10 minutes.\n2. Meanwhile, put all the ingredients for the\ntahini\nchocolate sauce in a small bowl, add three tablespoons of water and mix smooth. The sauce will thicken as it sits, so add a splash more water later, if need be; it needs to be pourable.\n3. Set up your dorayaki station: put the sunflower oil in a small bowl, and have to hand a pastry brush and a cooling rack.\nAdvertisement\n4. Put a large, nonstick frying pan (or large crepe pan) on a medium-low heat and brush very lightly with the oil. Don’t be tempted to turn up the heat – you don’t want the pancakes to colour too quickly. Blot any excess oil off the surface of the pan, because any large droplets will prevent the dorayaki’s signature smooth top from forming. Using an ice-cream scoop (if you have one; otherwise, use a tablespoon), weigh out 40g batter, drop it into the hot pan and leave to cook for three minutes, until the sides have set and small bubbles start to appear. Flip over the dorayaki with a spatula, cook for a minute more on the other side, until lightly golden, then transfer to the cooling rack. Repeat with the remaining batter, and cook two or three at a time once you’re more confident; you should end up with 10 in total. Leave the dorayaki on the rack to cool for 10-15 minutes.\n5. Meanwhile, put all the ingredients for the coffee cream in a medium bowl and whisk to soft peaks.\n6. To assemble, spoon 30g coffee cream on to a dorayaki, leaving a 5mm border all around the edge, then lay a second dorayaki on top, to sandwich them together. Repeat with the remaining dorayaki and cream, so you have five dorayaki cream sandwiches, then arrange on a platter and serve with the bowl of tahini chocolate sauce alongside, for dipping.",

There are two ways to chargrill the aubergines: on an open flame on the stove top, or in a chargrill pan on an induction hob followed by 10 minutes in a hot oven. See Glossary for more detailed instructions. Once cooked, the scooped-out flesh should weigh about 160g. Place this in the bowl of a food processor along with the yoghurt, garlic, lemon juice,\ntahini\nand ½ teaspoon of salt. Blitz for about a minute, until completely smooth, then set aside until needed.\n2. Prepare the cucumber by placing each half on a chopping board, cut side facing down. Using the flat side of a large knife, lightly ‘smack’ them until bruised but still holding their shape. Cut the cucumber into roughly 1cm dice and set aside.\n3. Clean the food processor, then add the parsley, mint, garlic, olive oil and ¼ teaspoon of salt. Blitz for about 2 minutes, scraping down the sides a couple of times if you need to, to form a smooth paste, then add to the cucumber. Set aside for at least 20 minutes (and up to a day in advance if kept in the fridge) for the flavours to infuse.\n4. Slice each head of baby gem lengthways to make 8 long thin wedges (per lettuce). When ready to assemble, arrange the lettuce on a round platter, overlapping the outer and inner circle to look like the petals of a flower. Lightly sprinkle the wedges with salt and a grind of black pepper, then splatter over the aubergine yoghurt. Spoon over the cucumber, drizzle with the shatta, sprinkle over the\nchilli flakes\nand serve.",

Blitz to combine and, with the motor still running, slowly pour in 60-70ml of hand-hot water, until the pastry comes together in a ball. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead for 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic, dusting with flour as needed. Cut the dough in half, to see if there are any air bubbles inside; if there are, knead for a few minutes more, until smooth. Wrap tightly with clingfilm and rest in the fridge for an hour.\nFill a small saucepan with plenty of salted water. Bring to a boil, add the potato and cook for 10-12 minutes, until soft.

Tip into the potato bowl and mix together well.\nOn a well-floured work surface, roll out the pastry into a large, thin circle 50cm in diameter and 1mm thick. (While rolling, you’ll need to keep turning over the pastry and dusting with flour so it doesn’t stick.) Use a round 8cm-wide pastry cutter to cut out 30 circles (if need be, roll out the scraps of pastry a second time to make up the 30).\nPut a heaped teaspoon of filling in the centre of each circle and brush all around the edge with water. Fold one half over the other, to form a semi-circle, and press the edges together firmly to seal (the seal should be 1cm wide). Place the pierogi on a large, flour-dusted tray.\nBring a large pan of salted water to a boil, turn down the heat to medium-high and add a third of the dumplings. Simmer for five minutes, then transfer to a large plate using a slotted spoon. Repeat with the remaining two batches of pierogi.\nPut a large sauté pan on a high heat with 10g of butter. Once frothing, add a third of the dumplings and fry for a minute, turning halfway through, until lightly golden and just slightly crisp. Remove from the pan and set aside somewhere warm while you repeat with the remaining dumplings, adding more butter as you go. Serve at once, with a generous spoon of soured cream alongside or on top and a sprinkling of chives.",

Grease a 12cm x 25cm loaf tin with a little butter, and line the base and sides with greaseproof paper.\nFirst, make the topping. Put the butter in a small saucepan on a low to medium heat. Leave to melt, then let it sizzle for a few minutes until it's light brown and smells slightly nutty. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. Once cool, mix the butter, walnuts and cinnamon, divide the mixture in two and stir the sugar into one of the portions (you may need to use your hands to break up the sugar and spread it evenly through the nuts).\nNow for the cake batter. In an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar on a medium speed until light and fluffy, then add the eggs a little at a time. Sift together the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and a pinch of salt, and bit by bit add this and the cream alternately. Make sure not to over-mix.\nSpread half the batter on the base of the cake tin and evenly scatter over the sugarless nut mix. Dot the halva on top, and spread the remaining batter over this – the halva will drag a bit into the batter, but don't worry about that. Finally, sprinkle the sugary nuts on top.\nBake for 40-45 minutes, until a skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool for 20 minutes, then gently remove from the tin by lifting the greaseproof paper. Take off the paper and leave the cake to cool on a wire rack (it may crumble otherwise). Wrapped, the cake will keep for a day or two.",

Lightly grease a 24cm spring-form tin, and line the sides and base with baking parchment.\nPut the butter, 300g of the sugar (the remaining 80g is for the syrup) and citrus zest in a mixer bowl, and use a paddle attachment to combine. Do not work the mix too much or incorporate much air. Add half the ground almonds and continue mixing to fold through. Add the eggs gradually, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl as you go. Add the remaining almonds, flour and salt, and work until the mix is smooth.\nSpread the cake batter inside the tin and level with a palette knife. Bake for 50-60 minutes - a skewer should come out a little bit moist.\nWhen the cake is almost cooked, in a small pan bring to a boil the remaining sugar and citrus juices (the juices should add up to about 120ml; don't use more), then remove from the heat at once. The moment the cake comes out of the oven, brush it all over with the hot syrup, making sure it all soaks through. Leave to cool down. Serve it as it is, garnished with orange strips, or store for up to three days in an airtight container.\nTo make the icing, put the butter, chocolate and honey in a heatproof bowl and place over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Stir until all is melted, remove from the heat and stir in the cognac. Pour the icing over the cool cake, allowing it to dribble naturally down the sides without covering the cake completely. Let the icing set, then garnish with strips of orange zest at the centre.",

Whisk the egg yolks, two tablespoons of sugar and the wine in a medium heatproof bowl, then set the bowl over a saucepan of gently simmering water (make sure the base of the bowl is not in contact with the water). Whisk for four or five minutes, until it looks like a thick, foamy cream, then take the bowl off the pan and leave to cool, whisking once or twice as it does so.\nWhile the sabayon is cooling, put the peaches, makrut lime leaves, lime juice, a teaspoon of lime zest and two tablespoons of sugar in a 20cm x 20cm high-sided baking dish. Stir everything together to combine, then roast for 15-25 minutes, until the peaches are soft but still hold their shape (the timing will depend on how ripe they are), then leave to cool.\nWhile the peaches are cooking, mix the raspberries with the remaining teaspoon of lime zest and two teaspoons of sugar.\nPut the cream in a medium bowl, whisk to soft peaks, then, using a spatula, fold into the cooled sabayon. If you’re not dishing up straight away, put it in the fridge and take out 15 minutes before serving. Spoon the peaches and any juices into four bowls, and serve with a generous spoonful each of sabayon and raspberries on the side.",

Heat the oven to 250C (230C fan)/ gas 9+. Prick the potatoes all over with a fork, about 10 times each. Put them directlyon the middle rack of the oven and bake for 45 minutes, or until cooked through.

Evenly drizzle over the egg yolks, then sprinkle on the flour, nutmeg, half a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper, and use your hands to bring the dough together; do not knead or overmix.\n3. Divide the dough into four equal pieces and then, on a lightly floured surface, roll each piece into a long cylinder about 25cm long. Cut into 12 even pieces of 15-20g each, then roll each piece of dough into a roughly finger-length torpedo shape. Transfer to a lightly floured tray lined with greaseproof paper, and repeat with the remaining potato mix.\n4. Bring a large saucepan of very well-salted water to a boil.

Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cooked dumplings to a colander to drain, then transfer to an oven tray lined with greaseproof paper and drizzle lightly with a little oil (so they don’t stick).\n5. Meanwhile, put the butter in a small saucepan on a medium heat, cook for 10-12 minutes, swirling the pan occasionally, until nutty and browned. Remove from the heat and stir in the poppy seeds and a quarter-teaspoon of salt.\n6. Put a teaspoon and a half of oil in a large, nonstick saute pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add a quarter of the dumplings and fry, flipping as required, for four to five minutes, until well browned all over. Transfer to a large plate while you repeat with the rest of the dumplings, adding a fresh teaspoon and a half of oil each time.\n7. Wipe out the saute pan and put it on a medium heat. Return the dumplings to the pan, pour over the browned butter and warm through for a couple of minutes. Divide the schupfnudeln between four plates and serve.",

Peel the potatoes. Leave the small ones whole and halve the larger ones, so you end up with pieces of around 60g each. Keep them in cold water to prevent discoloration.\nRinse the potatoes under cold water to remove the starch, then put in a large pan filled with cold water, bring to a boil and simmer for eight to 10 minutes. Drain into a colander and shake to roughen the edges - this will help achieve the desired crunchy skin.\nPut the goose fat in a roasting tray and heat in the oven for about eight minutes, until smoking. Carefully lift the tray from the oven, tip in the potatoes and use metal tongs to roll them around in the hot fat. Return the tray to the highest shelf of the oven and cook for 50 to 65 minutes, until the potatoes are golden and crunchy on the outside, and soft in the middle. While they are cooking, turn them over from time to time to make sure they colour evenly. Once the potatoes are almost ready, take the tray out of the oven and carefully tip out most of the fat into a heatproof bowl. Add the salt and prunes, and stir gently. Return to the oven for five minutes.\nDuring this time, make the caramel. Put the sugar in a heavy-based pan and place over a low heat. Without stirring, watch the sugar as it turns a rich, caramel colour. Keep your eyes on the sugar at all times because it can easily catch and burn. The moment it reaches the desired colour, remove from the heat. With your face at a safe distance, quickly pour the water into the caramel to stop it from cooking any more, then return to the heat and stir to eliminate any lumps.\nBefore serving, stir the caramel into the potatoes and prunes.

For the pasta, put the flour, semolina, whole eggs, egg yolks, plus two and a half tablespoons of the saffron and its soaking water in the large bowl of a food processor, and pulse for 30 seconds, until it’s the texture of sticky breadcrumbs. Tip the dough on to a lightly floured surface and knead vigorously for seven minutes, until smooth and pliable. Shape into a ball, cover with clingfilm and leave to rest for 30 minutes.\n2. Meanwhile, make the shallots. Heat the oil in a large frying pan on a high flame, then add all the shallot ingredients and fry for seven minutes; use a spatula to separate the rings as they cook. Turn the heat to medium-low, cook for six minutes more, until caramelised and a deep golden brown, then transfer to a plate lined with baking paper and spread the shallots out – they’ll be a bit sticky, but will crisp up a little as they cool.\n3. Mix all the ingredients for the pickled green chillies in a small bowl.\n4. Secure your pasta machine to a work surface. Divide the dough into four and keep three covered by a tea towel. Shape one piece of dough into a rectangle, then roll it through the widest setting of the machine twice, dusting with flour as you go. Fold in the ragged sides to meet in the middle (like a French window), then turn the sheet and pass it back through the machine twice more, dusting as you go, so all the sides are straight. Click to the next setting and roll the pasta through twice more, dusting as you go. Repeat, rolling the pasta through each setting twice, until you get to the second-last setting (you don’t want the pasta to be too thin). Once you have a long, lightly dusted sheet, fold it in half lengthways about four times, dusting each fold with a little flour, so it doesn’t stick together, then use a very sharp knife to cut into 2cm-thick strips, to make wide tagliatelle. Toss in a little more flour, cover with a clean tea towel and repeat with the remaining dough.\n5. Put 50ml oil, the garlic and a quarter-teaspoon of salt in a large saute pan on a medium-high heat, fry gently for two minutes, then turn off the heat.\n6. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta, cook for a minute, stirring with a fork to separate the strands, then drain; reserve 140ml of the cooking water.\n7. Tip the hot pasta into the garlic pan and turn the heat to medium-high. Add the reserved pasta water, the remaining saffron and its water, the parsley and lots of pepper, and toss. Add the parmesan bit by bit, tossing as it melts, for two to three minutes.\n8. Transfer the pasta to a platter with a lip and dot with ricotta.

Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas 6. Melt the butter and a tablespoon of oil in a large saute pan on a medium heat, then fry the onion, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes, until it’s completely softened and deeply caramelised. Set aside.\n2. While the onions are cooking, heat the remaining tablespoon and a half of oil in a large saute pan on a medium-high flame. Once hot, fry the chard stems for five minutes, until softened, then add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds more. Add the chard leaves, half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper, and cook for three minutes, until the chard has wilted and released some of its liquid. Transfer to a sieve set over a bowl, gently squeeze out any excess moisture, then put in a bowl and mix in the parsley, raisins, pine nuts, half a teaspoon of sumac and the caramelised onions, and leave to cool.\n3. Make the crust by whisking both the flours in a large bowl with the sugar, salt and herbs. Add the butter and incorporate it into the flour by squashing each cube between your fingers. Don’t overwork the butter – you want chunks throughout the dough – so a light squish will do. Add the water and use your hands to gather the dough together into a shaggy mess – it will be quite wet.\n4. Transfer the dough to a well-floured work surface and roll out into a rectangle about 28cm x 18cm. Fold the longer ends in towards each other, so they meet in the centre, then roll over once with a rolling pin. Fold in the shorter ends in the same way, roll out once again, then fold in half, so you’re left with a square. Wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate for 20 minutes.\n5. On a well-floured surface, roll out the chilled dough into a 28cm-diameter disc, then carefully lift on to an oven tray lined with baking paper. Spread the ricotta all over the dough, leaving a 1cm rim all around the outside edge, then cover with half the blue cheese. Top with the chard filling and the remaining blue cheese.\n6. Use a knife to make small, 2cm cuts about 8cm apart all around the circumference of the galette. Take one of the resulting dough strips and fold it inwards towards the centre. Repeat with the next strip, pulling gently so it overlaps slightly with the previous one and seals the previous fold. Repeat with all the strips all around the edge of the galette, then refrigerate for 30 minutes. Brush the edges with egg wash and sprinkle with the remaining sumac.\n7. Bake for 25 minutes, until golden and cooked through, then leave to cool and rest for 15 minutes before serving warm.",

Transfer to a large bowl, add the rice, apple, dill and tarragon, and stir.\nLay a vine leaf flat on a work surface, with its stem pointing towards you and the shiny side facing down. Spoon a tablespoon of the rice mixture into the centre-bottom part of the leaf, then shape it as follows: take the two sides of the leaf, fold them tightly over the rice and then roll towards the top of the leaf, so that you end up with a tight, 5cm x 3cm cigar shape. Repeat with remaining leaves and filling. Wipe clean the sauté pan and arrange the stuffed leaves inside, close together and in one or two neat layers.\nMix the remaining olive oil with the lemon juice and 250ml water, and pour over the vine leaves. Cover the pan with a lid, bring the liquid to a simmer and cook very gently for about 40 minutes, until the rice is cooked and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Remove from the heat and leave the dolmas to sit in the pan and cool for at least 20 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature, with the yoghurt on the side.",

Remove from the oven and turn the heat down to 180°C fan.\n5. Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce. Put the oil into a large saucepan over a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes until softened and lightly coloured. Add the garlic and spices and cook, stirring continuously, for 1 minute more, then add the tinned tomatoes, sugar, 400ml of water, 1 3⁄4 teaspoons of salt and a good grind of pepper. Bring to a simmer, then turn the heat down to medium and cook for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened slightly. Stir in the coriander, then measure out 700g of sauce (you’ll use this to build the pie). Keep the rest in the pan, to warm up when serving.\n6. In a bowl, toss together the kataifi, half the pecorino and the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil.\n7. Next assemble the pie. Line a 23cm springform cake tin with a piece of baking parchment large enough to cover the base and sides. Cover the base with a third of the aubergine slices (cutting them to fit, as needed). Top with a third of the sauce, a third of the mozzarella and a third of the remaining pecorino. Continue in this way with the remaining aubergine, sauce and cheeses. Lastly, top evenly with the kataifi mixture and bake for 35 minutes. Turn the heat up to 200°C fan and bake for 15–20 minutes more, or until nicely golden on top. Remove from the oven and leave to set for about 30 minutes.\n8. Remove the outer ring of the tin and use the paper to help you lift the pie on to a board. Heat up the extra sauce and serve the pie warm, or at room temperature, with the extra sauce alongside.",

Preheat your oven to 190C.\n2. In a large mixing bowl, mix the squash, maple syrup and cinnamon with 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 teaspoon salt. Place on a large oven tray and bake for 15 minutes until just cooked through. Remove from the oven and transfer back into the mixing bowl to cool for 15 minutes then refrigerate until needed.\n3. Put a medium saucepan onto a medium high heat and add in the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Stir in the leeks, spring onions, garlic and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook for 8 minutes until the leeks have softened, then add 1 tablespoon za’atar and cook for one more minute. Add in the chard with 1 tablespoon of water and cook for a further 2 minutes.

Cut one sheet down to 15x40cm, and, if you like, use a small christmas cookie cutter to cut out shapes from the trim (optional). Place the untrimmed sheet onto a large, lined baking and place the cut-outs alongside. Refrigerate until ready to use. Place the trimmed puff pastry sheet on a large lined baking tray, pierce all over with a fork and use a knife to lightly mark a 4 cm border around the edges.\n6. Spoon the cooled leeks on top of the base of the trimmed sheet, avoiding the edges, then spread the butternut squash on top. Brush the border with the beaten egg, then take your refrigerated sheet of pastry and drape it over the pie. Use a fork to press down and seal all along the border, then trim and discard any rough edges. Brush the pie and the cut-outs (if using) with any extra beaten egg, then arrange the cut-outs on top of the pie. Sprinkle the pie evenly with the remaining 1½ tsp za’atar. Refrigerate the pie on its tray for at least one hour or overnight if getting ahead.\n7. Preheat the oven to 210C.\n8. Bake the pie from cold for 15 minutes, until golden. Reduce the temperature to 170C and cook for a further 45 minutes, until cooked through. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for at least 20 minutes.

Pour the beaten egg into the pan and stir to combine with the onion, spinach and herbs. Nestle the feta in the centre of the egg mixture, so it’s three-quarters submerged, then drizzle the remaining teaspoon of oil and the remaining half-teaspoon of cumin over the top. Transfer the pan to the oven, bake for 15 minutes, then remove and turn the oven grill to its highest setting. Once the grill is hot, pop the pan on the top shelf of the oven closest to the grill and cook for two minutes until the frittata is golden brown and the top of the feta slightly coloured.\n5. Using a spatula, release the frittata from the bottom of the pan, then carefully slide it on to a serving plate. Sprinkle over the remaining dill and the aleppo chilli, and serve warm or at room temperature with the lemon wedges on the side.",

Line a 24cm x 14cm loaf tin with clingfilm, so it drapes over the sides.\nCut the larger strawberries into quarters and smaller ones in half.\nPut 550g strawberries in a 30cm baking dish, then stir in 100g sugar, a teaspoon of vanilla bean paste and two-thirds of the orange zest. Roast for 30 minutes, stirring once halfway, until the strawberries have produced a syrup, then leave to cool.\nTo make a sabayon, whisk the egg yolks, sauternes and 20g sugar in a medium heatproof bowl, then set over a saucepan of simmering water (ensure the base is not in contact with the water). Whisk for four to five minutes, until the mixture resembles a thick, foamy cream, then take the bowl off the pan and leave to cool, whisking once or twice as it does so. Set aside to cool, then mix in the mascarpone using a spatula.\nIn a small bowl or cup, mix the Grand Marnier with the shot of espresso, if using.\nPut the double cream and the remaining orange zest and vanilla paste in the bowl of a stand mixer and whip to soft peaks – about a minute.\nBlitz the remaining strawberries with the remaining tablespoon of sugar for 30 seconds.\nTo assemble the cake, pour the roasted strawberries and their syrup into the lined loaf tin. Cover with a row of biscuits, pushing them down so they soak up the syrup. Turn over the biscuits and push them down again, to soak the other side, too. Drizzle half the Grand Marnier mix over the biscuits, then spread the sabayon on top in an even layer. Spread the whipped cream evenly over the sabayon, then pour the blitzed fresh strawberries over the cream. Top with a second layer of biscuits (you may need to cut some in half lengthways to fill in any gaps) and drizzle the remaining Grand Marnier evenly over the biscuits. Push the biscuits into the blitzed strawberries, then turn them over to soak the other side. Pull the clingfilm tightly over the top, and refrigerate for at least five hours, or overnight.\nTo serve, unwrap the clingfilm lid and put a large plate on top of the loaf tin. Hold the plate and tin together, then quickly flip over to invert. Gently lift off the tin: the cake should release itself from the tin and on to the plate; if it does not, tap the tin gently until it does. Peel off the clingfilm and serve at once.",

Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.\nIncrease the oven temperature to 185°C/165°C Fan/Gas Mark 5. Line the base and sides of a high-sided 20cm square or 23cm round tin (with a removable base) with baking parchment.\nPlace the butter, sugar and lemon zest in the bowl of an electric mixer with the paddle attachment in place. Beat on a medium-high speed, until light and creamy. Add the egg yolks, one at a time, and beat until combined. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt together into a bowl. Add the coconut and stir to combine. With the machine on a low speed, gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mix, alternating with the milk and vanilla. Scrape the batter into the prepared tin – it will only rise about a fifth of the way up the sides – and smooth the top evenly. Place in the oven and cook for 25 minutes, until the cake is fully cooked and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.\nMeanwhile, prepare the plums. Slice each plum vertically in half. Discard the stones and slice each half into four segments so that you have eight segments per plum and forty segments in total. If you start with a larger quantity of smaller plums, or another smaller stone fruit like cherries, then just quarter each fruit.\nWhen the cake is cooked, remove it from the oven and turn the temperature up to 200°C/180°C Fan/Gas Mark 6. Gently lay the plum segments on top of the cake, close together and cut side down. Don’t overlap the fruit, though, as this will make the middle layer too watery.\nTo make the meringue, place the egg whites and salt in a clean bowl of an electric mixer with the whisk attachment in place. Beat on a medium-high speed for about 1 minute until soft peaks form. Add the sugar, a tablespoon at a time, and continue to whisk on a high speed until the egg whites are stiff and glossy. Add the vanilla, vinegar and cornflour and whisk again until combined. Finally, fold in the toasted flaked almonds.\nScrape the meringue into the cake tin, on top of the plums, and spread out evenly over the fruit. Swirl the meringue around so you get rough waves and peaks, then place in the oven. Immediately lower the oven temperature to 180°C/160°C Fan/ Gas Mark 4 and bake for 35 minutes, or until the meringue has formed a hard crust and is just beginning to brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the cake tin for at least 30 minutes before pushing up the removable base to release the cake.

Lastly, gently place the reserved shallots, cut-side up, on top of the custard and cheese so they’re laying on top. Carefully transfer to the oven and bake for 15-18 minutes, until the custard is set with a very slight wobble.\n7. When ready to serve, spoon the rayu all over the custard bake and serve warm.",

Quarter the plums, discarding the stones, and put in a bowl. Trim off and discard the rhubarb leaves, cut the stalks into 3cm-long segments and add to the plums. Cut the vanilla pod along its centre, scrape out the seeds and add both seeds and pod to the fruit. Add the ground star anise, sugar and orange juice to the bowl, and mix together with your hands. Transfer the contents of the bowl to a medium-large, ovenproof dish, then push down with a fish slice, or similar, to create a more or less even surface.\nNow make the topping. In an electric mixer with a paddle attachment, and on low speed, mix the flour, salt, sugar and baking powder. Cut the butter into small dice, add to the dry ingredients and mix until the butter is dispersed and the mix resembles coarse, uneven breadcrumbs. Stop the machine, add the cream and work just until everything comes together.\nTransfer the mix to a lightly floured surface and knead it a little, just until smooth. Using a rolling pin, roll out the pastry into a 1cm thick sheet. Use a round pastry cutter (or a star cutter for a festive effect) to stamp out discs.\nArrange the discs over the fruit. Lay them out neatly and close together, so they touch, or even slightly overlap. Gently brush the discs with a little bit of egg and top with a restrained scattering of caster sugar.\nBake for an hour; it could take a bit less or even longer, depending on the fruit. It's ready when the fruit is hot and bubbly, and the topping golden and cooked through. Serve warm, lightly dusted with icing sugar, if you like, and with a blob of crème fraîche on each portion.",

Add the cumin and fennel seeds and cook for another minute. Stir in the tomato paste and then add the raki or ouzo. Allow this to bubble away for a couple of minutes. Mix in the tomatoes, sugar, half of the thyme, the lemon skin, 1 teaspoon of salt and some black pepper and stir well. Simmer gently until the sauce thickens, 15-20 minutes, adding a little extra water if it goes much thicker than your typical pasta sauce. Taste and add salt and pepper accordingly. Remove from the heat and discard the lemon peel.\nDivide the hot sauce evenly between four individual casserole dishes or small pans. Alternatively, use one large dish. Season the sea bass pieces with salt and pepper and dot them inside, skin side down. Arrange over the squid followed by the prawns. Press the feta pieces around the fish so that they are also slightly submerged in the sauce. Finish with the remaining tablespoon of thyme leaves. Place on the top shelf in the oven 8-12 minutes, depending on the size of your dishes, or until the seafood is just cooked, the sauce bubbles nicely and the cheese turns golden.\nJust before the casseroles are done, melt the butter in a small frying pan until it starts to foam. Add the chilli and cook until the butter just begins to brown. Pour in the lemon juice, stir and remove from the heat. Spoon this over the hot casseroles as soon as they come out of the oven. Sprinkle with the fennel fronds and serve hot with bread on the side.",

Preheat the oven to 180°C fan and place a large baking tray inside to heat up.\n2. Grease a 32cm x 22cm x 3cm Swiss roll tin. Line with a piece of baking parchment large enough to cover the base and rise about 4cm up and over the sides (this will help you lift out the pie later).\n3. Take one of the puff pastry sheets and roll it out to form a 38cm x 28cm rectangle. Transfer it to the prepared tin, making sure to push it inside the corners and up the sides. Refrigerate while you prepare the filling.\n4. In a large mixing bowl, combine both the cheeses, the olives, spring onions, herbs, potatoes, 3⁄4 teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of pepper. Try to separate the potato slices as much as possible so they’re all evenly distributed.\n5. Transfer the potato mixture into the pastry-lined tin, filling the corners and pressing down on the mixture so that it is tightly packed. It will seem like too much but it will cook down in the oven.\n6. In a medium jug or bowl, whisk three of the eggs, the extra yolk, double cream and crème fraîche. Pour this evenly over the filling.\n7. Unroll the second piece of puff pastry and lay it on top of the potatoes, tucking it between the potatoes and the pastry sides. Lightly whisk the remaining egg and brush this over the pastry. Then, with a slight lifting and pulling motion, fold the pastry sides over the edges of the top layer and press down gently to seal. Brush the edges with egg wash and sprinkle over the sesame seeds. Using a sharp knife, make seven diagonal scores along the length of the top of the pie, each around 5cm long.\n8. Carefully, place the pie tin on top of the hot baking tray in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Rotate the tin and bake for another 30 minutes until golden and cooked through. If the top of the pie gets too dark too early, turn the heat down to 170°C fan. Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin and on a wire rack for about 1 hour.\n9. Use the paper overhang to lift and slide the pie out of the tin. Set the tin aside and place the pie back on to the wire rack to cool completely, about 11⁄2 hours. Cut into 20 squares.\n10. While the pie is cooling, make the salsa verde. Put all the herbs, the olives, garlic, anchovies, vinegar, half the oil and plenty of pepper into a food processor and pulse a few times, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary, until you have a coarse paste. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, then transfer to a serving bowl to eat alongside the pie.",

Put a 20cm x 20cm nonstick square tin (or a similar sized ovenproof dish) in the oven to warm; make sure the tin isn’t spring-form, though, because you don’t want the caramel to escape.\nFor the caramel, put the sugar in a large pan on a medium heat and cook for about eight minutes: resist the urge to stir, and instead swirl the pan around until the sugar has melted. Continue swirling slowly until the sugar turns a dark amber, then quickly take the tin from the oven and pour in the caramel, tilting the tin as you go so it covers the base evenly. Leave the caramel to set while you make the custard.\nTake the\nchilli\nfrom its soaking water and squeeze out any liquid. Discard the stalk, put the chilli, seeds included, and all the other custard ingredients in a blender and blitz on high speed for about 30 seconds, until well combined.\nTap the base of the caramel tin to check it has set (if it hasn’t, leave it a little longer), then pour in the custard through a mesh sieve, to catch any larger bits of chilli.\nGently lift the tin into a larger, high-sided baking dish and put in the oven. Carefully pour boiling water into the larger dish to come halfway up the sides of the tin, then bake for 40-50 minutes, until the surface is set and golden-brown, but the flan still has a good wobble to it (it will set more in the fridge). Lift the flan out of its water bath, leave to cool slightly, then refrigerate for at least three hours.\nTake the flan out of the fridge half an hour before you want to eat it. To serve, run a knife around the edge of the flan to release it, and place a lipped plate larger than the tin on top of the flan tin. Holding both the plate and the tin together, quickly flip the whole thing over and gently lift off the tin: the flan should release itself on to the plate.

T’was the night before Christmas…so let’s start with the rice pudding.\nCombine the milk, sugar, salt, vanilla, lemon strips and rice in a medium saucepan, for which you have a lid, and place on medium high heat. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to medium low and cook, partially covered, for 30-35 minutes until the rice is fully cooked and is thick and creamy, stirring occasionally at the beginning and then more frequently towards the end. Transfer to a shallow bowl, cover the surface of the rice with a piece of parchment paper and leave to cool. Once cool, transfer to the fridge overnight (the rice will absorb more of the milk as it sits).\n2. Make the brittle. Preheat the oven to 160c and line a baking tray with parchment paper. Add the almonds to the tray and roast for about 15 minutes, stirring halfway through, until they are nicely toasted. Keep warm.\nMeanwhile, heat a small saucepan on medium high heat and, when hot, sprinkle in half of the sugar. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has melted and is starting to turn golden. Add the remaining sugar and cook, stirring occasionally, to a medium amber colour.\nAdd the butter and whisk until fully combined.\nTake off the heat and add the warm almonds (keep the tray and paper) and salt and stir until they are evenly coated in the caramel, placing the pan back on the heat briefly if the mixture cools down too quickly. Transfer the mixture back to the tray and spread out a little. Set aside to cool. Once cool, roughly chop 75g of the brittle and set aside. The brittle can be kept in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two weeks.\n3. For the compote, combine the cherries, sugar, lemon zest and juice in a medium saucepan and place on medium high heat. Make a slurry with the Amaretto and cornflour and set aside. As soon as the cherries come up to a simmer, stream in the slurry, stirring constantly, followed by the sumac. Let the cherries bubble for about 1 minute until thickened. Keep warm.\n4. Transfer the rice pudding to a medium bowl and add the Amaretto, if using, to help loosen the mixture. Whip the cream with the vanilla to soft peaks and fold it through the rice in two additions, adding 75g of the chopped almond brittle with the second addition. Spoon the rice into 4 serving bowls (there will be enough for seconds!), hiding the whole almond in one of the bowls. Spoon over the warm cherry compote, sprinkle with some extra sumac and finish with a couple of pieces of brittle.",

        "content": "Ingredients\n500ml full-fat yogurt (not the set or Greek varieties)\nSalt and black pepper\n375g all-butter puff pastry\n1 egg, beaten\n6 small-medium aubergines\n1 clove garlic, crushed\n3 tbsp parsley leaves, roughly chopped\n3 tbsp lemon juice\n1 pomegranate\n1 tsp black sesame seeds\n1 tbsp olive oil\n\nMethod\nPrepare the yogurt a day in advance. Line a large sieve with muslin and rest it over a bowl. Pour in the yogurt, sprinkle with half a teaspoon of salt, stir and tie into a parcel. Leave in the fridge overnight. The yogurt will lose lots of liquid and go thick and creamy.\nNext, make the pastry cases (this can also be done a day ahead). Roll out the pastry 5mm thick, then cut it into eight squares (8cm x 8cm), or use a 10cm round cutter to stamp out circles (this will give you only four to six pieces). Put the pastry shapes on a baking sheet lined with greaseproof paper. Score a shallow border all around about 1.5cm from the edge - take care not to cut all the way through (if making rounds, a smaller cutter will make life easier). Prick the inner part with a fork and brush the border with beaten egg. Chill for at least 20 minutes and up to 24 hours.\nYou can prepare the smoked aubergine in one of two ways. Line the base of a gas ring with foil, turn the flame to high, then char the aubergines all over for 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the flesh is soft and the skin burned and flaky. Or put them under a hot grill for 40-60 minutes, turning occasionally (they may burst slightly, but don't worry). Set aside the aubergines until just cool enough to handle.\nPreheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Bake the vol-au-vents for 10 minutes, until risen and golden brown (check underneath to make sure they are done). 'Peel' off a layer of pastry from the centre to create a cavity and set the cases aside somewhere warm.\nMake an incision along the centre of each still-hot aubergine and scoop out the flesh. Drain this in a colander, then chop and mix with garlic, parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste.\nTo serve, spoon a generous amount of warm aubergine (reheated in a pan if necessary) into the vol-au-vents. Spoon yogurt on top and swirl the two together a little. Scatter with pomegranate and black sesame seeds, drizzle with olive oil and serve.",

        "content": "Ingredients\n1 large red pepper\n1 medium sweet potato, peeled and cut into 3cm dice\nHalf a small courgette, cut into 3cm dice\n2 small onions, peeled and thinly sliced\n1 bay leaf\n200g shortcrust pastry\n3 sprigs of thyme, picked\n50g goat's cheese\n4 cherry tomatoes, halved\n1 large free-range egg\n130ml double cream\nAbout 50ml olive oil\nSalt and black pepper\n\nMethod\nSet the oven to 230C/Gas 8. Use a small serrated knife to cut around the stem of the pepper and lift it out along with the seeds. Shake the pepper to remove all the remaining seeds and discard the stem and seeds.\nPlace the pepper in a small ovenproof dish, drizzle with a little oil and put on the top shelf in the oven. Mix the sweet potato in a bowl with two tablespoons of olive oil and some salt and pepper, lay in a medium baking tray and place on the oven shelf beneath the peppers.\nAfter 12 minutes add the courgette to the sweet potato and stir gently. Return to the oven for another 12 minutes or until both vegetables are cooked but still firm. Leave the pepper in the oven for another 10-12 minutes, or until it is thoroughly brown, then remove and cover with foil until it cools down. Once cool, peel and break roughly into strips.\nWhile the vegetables are roasting, sauté the onion on the stove top along with the bay leaf, some salt and a tablespoon of olive oil. Cook them on a medium heat for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they turn brown, soft and sweet. Remove from the heat, discard the bay leaf and set aside.\nReduce the oven temperature to 160C/Gas 3.\nLightly grease a 16-18cm tart tin with a removable base. Roll out the pastry to a circle roughly 3mm thick and large enough to line the base and sides of the tin, plus extra to hang over the edge. Carefully line the tart case with the pastry, making sure you don't puncture it. Press the pastry so it covers the base and sides of the tin, with the excess hanging over the edge.\nLine the pastry base with a large sheet of baking parchment (make sure it covers the base and sides) and fill it with ceramic baking beans. Bake blind for 40 minutes. Carefully remove the paper with the beans. Give the case another 10 minutes in the oven so it turns golden brown. Remove and allow to cool a little.\nNow, scatter the base of the tart with the cooked onion and top with the roasted vegetables; try to arrange them evenly, then scatter half the thyme over them. Next, dot the veg with chunks of cheese and then with tomatoes, cut side facing up.\nWhisk the egg and cream in a small bowl, along with some salt and pepper. Carefully and slowly, pour this mix into the tart. Make sure the top layer remains exposed so you can see the vegetables and cheese. Scatter the remaining thyme on top and place in the oven. Cook for 30-40 minutes or until the filling sets and turns golden. Remove and allow to rest for at least 10 minutes before breaking off the excess pastry, taking the tart out of the tin and serving.",

Put the first nine ingredients, the lime juice and one and-a-half teaspoons of flaked salt in a large saucepan on a medium heat. Cover with a small plate to keep the fish below the surface of the oil. Once the oil starts to bubble, reduce the heat to its lowest setting and cook for 45 minutes, until the fish is tender and flaky. If the oil bubbles at all, take the pan off the heat until it stops, then put it back – the heat throughout should be very gentle. Leave the fish to cool for 15 minutes before serving.\n2. Meanwhile, make the tortillas. Put the masa harina and a good pinch of salt in a medium bowl, slowly pour in 250ml boiling water, and stir to combine. Cover with a damp towel and leave the mixture to cool – it will be quite wet and loose to begin with, but the flour will absorb the water as it cools. Once the dough is cool enough to handle, knead it into a smooth, round ball – it should feel like playdough. If it feels at all dry, just wet your hands a little as you knead it.\n3. Divide the dough into 12, pieces weighing about 30g each. Lightly grease a surface and your hands with a little vegetable oil and roll each piece into a smooth ball, adding a little more oil if the dough sticks to the surface. Keep any dough that you are not working with covered with a damp cloth.\n4. Heat a large frying pan on a high heat until it is very hot. Have a folded, very slightly damp tea towel ready on the side to tuck tortillas in once cooked. Squash each ball between pieces of baking paper with a heavy pan, into 12cm discs. Take off the top piece of paper, flip into the pan, cook for 10 seconds, then take off the top piece of paper. Cook on the same side for another minute or two, until brown spots begin to form, then flip and cook for a minute more. Remove, cover with a tea towel and repeat with the remaining tortillas.\n5. Transfer the fish, aromatics and oil to a large, shallow bowl and sprinkle with the coriander and some flaked salt. Squeeze the lime wedges on top and serve with the tortillas.",

Line the tart shell with a piece of baking parchment large enough to cover the base and sides, and then fill the tin with baking beans. Place onto a flat tray then bake in the oven for 30 minutes. Carefully remove the parchment and baking beans. Use the reserved pastry to fill any holes or cracks that have appeared, then return to the oven for 10 minutes until golden. Use an oven cloth to carefully release the outer ring of the springform tin to reveal the pastry. Use a pastry brush to apply a thin layer of the beaten egg to the outer and inner edges and base of the tart shell, then return to the oven for a final 2 minutes. Set the tart shell aside for later, and return the baking tray to the oven.\n4. Meanwhile, place the onions, butter, ¾ teaspoon of salt and 2 tablespoons of water into a medium saucepan and cook over a medium heat for 15 minutes, until soft and caramelised, stirring occasionally. Add the za’atar and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly, then add the spinach. Cook for 10 minutes until the spinach is wilted and any liquid has evaporated. Add the peas and cook for a further minute, just until defrosted, then transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl. Mix in the creme fraiche, cream, eggs and gruyere. Carefully place the tart shell back onto the baking tray, then spoon the quiche mixture into the tart shell. Don’t worry, the mixture won’t entirely fill the tart shell. Bake in the oven for 35 minutes until the quiche is set and cooked through. Leave to cool for at least 30 minutes.\n5. To make the jewelled salsa, top and tail the lemon and using a small, sharp knife, cut around its curves to remove the skin and pith. Save this for another use. Over a bowl, cut between the membranes to release the segments and catch any juice collected, then roughly chop the segments. Repeat with the second lemon. Add the segments to the bowl along with the oil, pomegranate, sesame, coriander seeds, a pinch of salt and a good crack of black pepper and mix to combine.\n6. Just before serving, toss together the pea shoots and herbs and pile this on top of the quiche, then drizzle the jewelled salsa over the salad.",

Preheat the oven to 160c fan and line a large baking tray with parchment paper.\n2. Combine the sugar, golden syrup and 25g of the butter in a small saucepan and place on a medium heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has melted and the mixture is emulsified. Add the warm sesame seeds and salt and stir to combine. Transfer to the prepared baking tray and smooth out a little with the back of a spoon (don’t worry about it being too perfect - it will spread as it bakes). Bake for 15-20 minutes, rotating the tray halfway through, until golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely (it will set as it cools). Can be stored for about a week in a sealed container at room temperature.\n3. Once cool, break the praline into large pieces and place most of it in the small bowl of a food processor, reserving a couple of pieces for serving. Add the vanilla and blitz until it forms a runny paste, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Be patient, this will take a good 5-7 minutes. This is now\nTransfer to a small bowl and add the remaining 75g butter. Mash together with a fork and set aside at cool room temperature until ready to serve (or in the fridge if preparing ahead).\n4.\nFor the apples\n, place a large non-stick saute pan on a medium high heat and add the butter. Once the butter starts to foam, add the apples, sugar, salt and cinnamon. Cook until the apples are soft, translucent and starting to caramelise around the edges, stirring every now and again, about 10 minutes.\nAdd the maple syrup and vinegar - be careful as the mixture may splutter. Let the mixture bubble away and thicken for a minute or so, swirling the pan gently as you do so. Remove from the heat, but keep in the pan.\n5.\nFor the pancakes\n, combine the milk and apple cider vinegar in a large jug and set aside to curdle for 15 minutes. Add the eggs, egg white, vanilla and melted butter and whisk to combine.\n6. Meanwhile, combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl and whisk together. Use a whisk to gently fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until no visible dry bits of flour remain. Do not over mix though - a few lumps here and there are totally fine. Set aside to rest and thicken slightly while you preheat a non-stick frying pan on a medium low heat for 5 minutes or so. The longer the batter sits, the thicker it will be - it can happily sit for half an hour or so.\n7. Once your pan is hot, drop three large spoonfuls of batter into the pan, evenly spaced apart, and cook for 2-3 minutes until the batter has risen and you can start to see small bubbles appear on the surface. Carefully flip the pancakes over and cook for another 30-60 seconds until the surface springs back when lightly touched.\nTransfer to a wire rack and continue with the remaining batter. The pancakes can be kept warm in a low oven while you cook the rest. Any leftover pancakes will keep for up to three days in the fridge - reheat in a dry pan or toaster. They are also delicious cold, spread with butter and jam!\n8. When ready to serve, gently warm up the apples. Stack three pancakes onto a serving plate and dollop a spoonful of the praline butter in between the pancakes. Finish with a final spoonful on the top and pile some of the apples on top, drizzling over a couple of spoonfuls of the maple sauce. Finish with a dollop of creme fraiche and some of the reserved sesame praline sprinkled on top.",

Heat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Line the bottom and sides of a 24cm loose-based cake tin with baking parchment. Put the butter and sugar in an electric mixer bowl, and use a beater to work them well until they turn light and pale. Beat the eggs lightly, then, with the machine on medium speed, add them gradually to the bowl, just a dribble at a time, adding more only once the previous addition is fully incorporated. Once all the egg is in, mix together the almonds, flour, salt, vanilla and anise, and fold into the batter. Mix until the batter is smooth, then fold in the yogurt.\n2. Pour the batter into the lined tin and level roughly with a palette knife or a spoon. Cut each fig vertically into four long wedges, and arrange in circles on top of the cake, just slightly immersed in the batter. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 170C/340F/gas mark 3 and continue baking until it sets - about 40-45 minutes longer. Check this by inserting a skewer in the cake: it's done if it comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool down before taking it out of the tin and sprinkling with a teaspoon of caster sugar.\n3. You can eat the cake just as it is, but the addition of warm, syrupy figs turns it into something very special. Once the cake is cool enough, divide it into portions. Put three tablespoons of caster sugar in a medium saucepan and put on a high heat until the sugar starts to caramelise. Remove from the heat, carefully add the wine - it will spit a bit - then return to the heat and let the caramel dissolve in the wine. Add the fig quarters and quickly toss them around just to warm them up. Spoon a generous dollop of Greek yogurt over each slice of cake, plus a few warm figs and their juice.",

        "content": "Ingredients\n1 large cauliflower, trimmed and cut into bite-size florets (700g)\n2 tsp mild curry powder\n3 tbsp olive oil\n100g unsalted butter, 50g cut into roughly 3cm cubes and 50g melted\n75g plain flour\n675ml whole milk\n2 garlic cloves, crushed\n1 1/2 tbsp English mustard\n150g mature cheddar, roughly grated\n6 sheets of good-quality filo pastry (we use feuilles de filo)\nsalt and black pepper\n1 tbsp roughly chopped parsley, to serve\n1 1/2tsp lemon zest, to serve\n\nMethod\n1. Preheat the oven to 180°C fan. Line the bottom and sides of a 23cm springform cake tin with baking parchment.\n2. Put the cauliflower on a large, parchment-lined baking tray and toss with the curry powder, half the oil, 1⁄2 teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Roast for about 20 minutes, until cooked through and lightly coloured. Set aside, and turn the oven temperature down to 170°C fan.\n3. Meanwhile, make the béchamel. Put the cubed butter into a medium saucepan on a medium-high heat and, once melted, whisk in the flour and cook for 1–2 minutes – it should start to smell nutty (like popcorn). Turn the heat down to medium and slowly add the milk a little at a time, whisking continuously to prevent any lumps, until incorporated and the sauce is smooth. Cook, whisking often, for about 7 minutes, until thickened slightly. Off the heat, stir in the garlic, mustard, cheese and 1⁄4 teaspoon of salt until the cheese has melted.\n4. Keep your filo sheets under a damp tea towel to prevent them from drying out. In a bowl, combine the melted butter and the remaining 11⁄2 tablespoons of oil and keep to one side.\n5. Working one sheet at a time, brush the exposed side of the filo with the butter mixture and drape it into your prepared tin (buttered side up), pushing it down gently to fit. Continue in this way with the next filo sheet, brushing it with butter and then laying it over the bottom sheet, rotating\nit slightly so the overhang drapes over the sides at a different angle. Do this with all six sheets.\n6. Spoon half the béchamel into the base and top with the roasted cauliflower florets. Spoon over the remaining béchamel, then crimp up the overhang so that it creates a messy ‘scrunched-up’ border around the edges, leaving the centre of the pie exposed.\n7. Brush the top of the filo border with the remaining butter mixture, then transfer the tin to a baking tray and bake for 30 minutes.\n8. Using a tea towel to help you, carefully release the outer circle of the springform tin and return the pie to the oven for another 20–25 minutes, or until the sides are nicely coloured and everything is golden and bubbling. Leave to settle for 15 minutes.\n9. Top the pie with the parsley and lemon zest and serve warm.",

Preheat the oven to 200C.\nIn a mixer beat the butter and sugar until light, airy and pale in colour. Slowly add the eggs, a little bit a t a time; if the mixture looks split add a bit of flour to bring it back together. Finally, add the ground almonds, flour and a ¼ of a teaspoon of salt and beat just until everything comes together. Fold in by hand the diced apricots, raisins and alcohol, orange and lemon zest and flaked almonds. Set aside.\nDust your work surface with a little bit for flour and roll the puff pastry into a rectangle, 2-3 millimetres thick. Trim the edges down to 50cm long and 30cm wide rectangle and then cut it in into two rectangles, both measuring 15cm x 50cm. Spread the almond paste thinly over both of the pastry rectangles, leaving a 2cm border along the long edges.\nTaking one rectangle first, gently roll the longest edge over itself and roll the whole sheet into a long sausage, the seam facing down. Place on a baking tray lined with baking paper. Place one end in the centre of the tray and wrap around in a coil form, leaving a slight gap in the centre. Fold the end underneath the coil to seal it shut, brushing with a little egg to help stick. Repeat the same process with the 2nd pastry rectangle.\nPlace 3 apricot halves in the centre of each of the coils, slightly overlapping and forming a flower pattern. Brush the remaining egg over the pastry and refrigerate for 10 minutes.\nBake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes and then turn down to 170C and continue cooking for another 45 minutes. The two ensaimadas should be golden-brown all over. Cool on a wire rack, dust with the icing sugar and brush the apricots with some runny honey before serving warm or at room temperature.",

Preheat the oven to 200°C fan.\n2. Heat a large non-stick frying pan on a high heat until very hot.

Drain into a colander and leave to cool down.\nNext, take the lemons and, with a small, sharp knife, trim off their tops and tails. Now cut down their sides, along their round curves, to remove the skin and white pith. Over a medium bowl - to collect any juice that escapes - remove the individual lemon segments by cutting between the membranes.

The salsa can now be left at room temperature for a couple of hours, or refrigerated and used the next day.\nTo cook the squid, heat up a ridged griddle pan or a barbecue until really hot - again, this is an essential factor in the cooking process. Throw the squid pieces in the pan a few at a time, without crowding, grill for about one minute each side, then remove, and repeat with the remaining squid.\nOnce all the squid is cooked, toss it gently into the salsa ingredients. The heat of the squid will turn this into a warmish salad.\nAs you plate it, dot with the rocket and finish with a trickle of chilli oil.",

Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas 6. Put the potatoes in a medium saucepan of cold, well-salted water. Bring to a simmer, then cook for 25 minutes, until the potatoes are soft but still hold their shape. Drain and set aside to cool.\n2. While the potatoes are cooking, half-fill a large saucepan with water, bring to a boil, turn down the heat to medium-high so the water is boiling gently, then lower in five eggs and cook for six minutes. Drain, leave the eggs under the cold tap for a couple of minutes, to stop them cooking any more, then peel and set aside. Whisk the mayonnaise with the remaining two eggs and the mustard.\n3. Line the base and sides of a 20cm cake tin with greaseproof paper. Lay out the potatoes on a chopping board and squash them flat with a fork or potato masher, so they’re about 1.5cm thick. Put half the squashed potatoes in the base of the tin, pressing them very firmly together to form a compact layer. Sprinkle with a little flaked salt and pepper, then top with half the mackerel, half the spring onions and half the olives. Pour half the mayonnaise mix evenly over the top.\n4. Cut the soft-boiled eggs in half lengthways, and lay them yolk side up on top of the spring onions.\n5. Top with a final layer each of mackerel, spring onions and olives, in that order, then lay the remaining squashed potatoes on top, pressing them down to form a compact layer. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then pour over the remaining mayonnaise mixture and press the whole thing down very well to compact it.\n6. Toss the tomatoes with the harissa, maple syrup and two tablespoons of oil, and scatter evenly on top of the potato layer.\n7. Place a tray under the cake tin to catch any oil, then bake for 35-40 minutes, until the tomatoes have softened and are slightly charred. Refrigerate until cool and set, for at least four hours, and preferably overnight.\n8. Mix the parsley salsa ingredients, remove the cake from the tin and drizzle evenly with parsley salsa.",

Preheat the oven to 170C and line the base and sides of a 23 x 23cm brownie tin. Add both sugars, the vanilla, and the eggs to the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment in place. Whisk on high speed until light, creamy and tripled in volume, about 8 minutes. Switch to the paddle attachment, add the dry ingredients and paddle on low speed until almost combined. Slowly drizzle in the warm melted butter until thoroughly combined. Scrape the batter into the prepared tin and smooth out the top. Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown and a skewer inserted comes out clean.\n2. For the pecan brittle, preheat the oven to160C and line a small baking tray with parchment paper. Place both syrups in a small saucepan on medium heat, stir to combine and bring to a bubble. Add the pecans and salt and stir together gently until the pecans are fully coated in the syrup. Continue to bubble for 30 seconds or so. Pour onto the prepared tray, spreading them out as much as possible and bake for 10-15 minutes until slightly caramelised and set. Set aside to cool completely.\n3. For the caramelised clementines, use a small, sharp knife to trim the tops and tails off 10 of the clementines. Cut down along their round curves, removing the skin and white pith to expose the flesh, then cut into ¾ cm rounds. Place in a medium bowl and set aside. Zest the remaining 2 clementines to get 2 teaspoons of zest then juice to get two tablespoons. Set the juice and the zest aside. Place the cognac, orange blossom, Aleppo and salt into a small bowl and set aside. Place the sugar and water in a small saucepan and stir to combine. Cook over a high heat, gently swirling the pan from time to time so the sugar caramelises evenly, until dark amber in colour, about 6 minutes. Take off the heat and pour in the clementine juice, whisking until incorporated. Add the cognac mixture, whisk to combine and pour over the sliced clementines. Gently swirl the bowl to make sure the clementines are submerged in caramel. Refrigerate until cool.\n4. For the sabayon, place the yolks, vanilla and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk in place. Whisk on high speed until very pale and tripled in volume, approximately 5 minutes. Add the mascarpone, double cream, chestnut puree, clementine zest and cognac and whisk until smooth and thickened.\n5. To assemble the trifle, cut the sponge into 5-centimetre squares and arrange about six pieces in the bottom of a large, 26-centimetre trifle bowl. Spoon over 2 tablespoons of the clementine caramel and arrange a third of the clementines evenly around the sides of the bowl and amongst the sponges. Roughly chop the caramelised chestnuts and set 30 grams aside. Scatter a third of the remaining chestnuts over the sponges. Spoon over a third of the sabayon, followed by a third of the whipped cream. Repeat twice more for a total of three layers. For the last layer, spoon the cream and arrange the remaining clementines decoratively. Finish with a drizzle of the clementine caramel and a scattering of the remaining caramelised chestnuts. Chill for at least 3 hours and serve with any remaining caramel alongside.",

        "content": "Ingredients\n900g sheep’s yoghurt, or cow’s yoghurt as an alternative\n½ tsp salt\n100ml good-quality olive oil\n10g lemon thyme sprigs, plus a few extra picked thyme leaves to serve\n1 orange: finely shave the skin to get 6 strips\n200g blackberries\n250g raspberries\n300g strawberries, hulled and halved lengthways (or quartered if they’re larger)\n50g caster sugar\n1 lime: finely grate the zest to get 1 tsp, then juice to get 1 tbsp\n200g blueberries\n150g cherries, pitted\n\nMethod\n1. Put the yoghurt and salt into a medium bowl and mix well to combine. Line a colander with a piece of muslin large enough to hang over the sides and place the colander over a bowl. Transfer the yoghurt to the muslin and fold over the sides to completely encase the yoghurt. Place a heavy weight over the muslin (a few tins or jars will do), and transfer to the fridge to drain for at least 24 hours (and up to 48).\n2. Meanwhile, put the oil into a small saucepan, for which you have a lid, on a medium heat. Heat gently for about 7 minutes, or until tiny air bubbles form. Remove from the heat, add the thyme and orange strips, then cover with a lid and leave to infuse, ideally overnight, though half an hour will also do the job.\n3. The next day, put 50g of blackberries, 100g of raspberries and 100g of strawberries into the small bowl of a food processor along with the sugar and lime juice and blitz until completely smooth. Put all the remaining berries and the cherries into a large bowl along with the blitzed fruit and gently combine. You can serve it straight away or leave it in the fridge for a few hours, bringing it back to room temperature before serving.\n4. Spread the labneh out on a large platter. Spoon over the berries, then sprinkle with the lime zest. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the infused oil, along with a couple of the orange strips and the extra picked thyme leaves.",

Set the oven to very low, about 70C. Use one hand to dip the petals gently in the egg white, shake off any excess, then use your other hand to scatter them with sugar. You want them well covered and without lumps. Lay the petals on an oven tray lined with greaseproof paper and put in the oven for 30-45 minutes, until crisp, then remove. Some leaves will probably stick to the tray, so scrape them off gently as best you can. Don't worry if some tear - they will still be useful.\nTurn up the oven to 200C/400F/ gas mark 6. Line the base and sides of a swiss roll tin (33cm x 24cm) with a sheet of greaseproof paper that comes about 1cm above the sides.\nIn a large, clean bowl, whisk the egg whites with an electric mixer until they begin to firm up. Add the caster sugar in a slow stream, whisking, until you get a firm, glossy meringue. Use a large, metal spoon to fold in a teaspoon of vanilla essence, the vinegar and cornflour. Spread inside the lined tin and level with a palette knife.\nPop into the oven and lower the heat to 160C/325F/gas mark 3. Bake for 30 minutes, until a crust forms and the meringue is cooked through (it will be soft, mind). Remove and leave to cool in the tin.\nTip the meringue out of the tin and on to a piece of greaseproof paper. Carefully peel off the paper from the base. Place the creams in a mixing bowl, along with a tablespoon of icing sugar, the\nrose water\nand another teaspoon of vanilla. Whisk until the cream just holds its shape. Spread most of the cream mix over the original bottom side of the meringue, leaving a thin border around the edge and reserving a few tablespoons. Scatter cherries all over the cream.\nUse the paper to assist you in rolling up the meringue, along its long edge, into a perfect log shape. Carefully transfer to a serving dish. Use the reserved cream to create a rough, wavy strip along the top of the log, then chill for at least 30 minutes.\nWhen ready to serve, dust the log with icing sugar and scatter the dried rose petals over the strip of cream.",

Remove with a slotted spoon or tongs and place on a cooling rack.\nMake a thick icing by whisking together the icing sugar and lemon juice.  It should be very thick still pourable.

Spread all the nuts out on a baking tray and roast for 18 minutes, until they are fragrant and golden brown. Reduce the oven temperature to 90°C/70°C Fan/Gas Mark ¼ and leave the nuts in the oven until ready to fold into the nougat: the mix will seize up if the nuts are added cold.\nPlace the aniseed, if using, in a medium heavy-based saucepan and toast over a medium heat for 2 minutes, until fragrant. Transfer to a pestle and mortar, lightly crush and set aside.\nIn a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, water, glucose, honey, Pernod or ouzo, vanilla seeds and salt, and whisk to combine. Place over a medium heat and simmer gently until the sugar has dissolved, then increase the heat to mediumhigh. Resisting the urge to stir, continue to cook for about 15–20 minutes, until the temperature on a sugar thermometer is close to reaching 118°C. At this stage, place the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer with the whisk attachment in place and whisk on medium speed to form soft peaks. Keep an eye on the boiling syrup and, when the temperature on the thermometer registers exactly 121°C, pour half of the hot syrup into the soft peaks in a steady stream. Continue to whisk on a medium speed and return the remaining half of the syrup to the heat.\nContinue to simmer the remaining syrup until the temperature reaches exactly 145°C, taking care that it does not go over 148°C. Once the temperature is reached, pour the hot syrup – it will be light golden at this stage – over the egg whites in a steady stream, whisking all the time. Continue to whisk for another 6–8 minutes, until you have a thick ribbon-like consistency. To check if it is ready, take a little of the mixture between your fingers and press together then pull apart: the mix should stick together like chewing gum. Using a plastic spatula or large metal spoon, fold through the aniseed and warm nuts. You need to be careful here, as the bowl of the machine will still be hot. Scrape the mixture into the lined baking tin and even out with an offset or regular spatula or palette knife.\nCover the surface with some more rice paper, smooth side up, and press down firmly to remove any air bubbles. Set aside to cool overnight, uncovered or with a clean, dry tea towel draped over the top, then slide a hot knife around the edges to remove it from the tin. Cut into 6 long bars (23 x 4cm), if giving as gifts, or into smaller squares.",

Add the butternut squash, cinnamon, 2 tablespoons of oil, ½ teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper to a large bowl and toss well to combine. Transfer to a parchment lined baking tray then add the onion rounds to the same bowl along with 1½ teaspoons of oil, 1/8th teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper and toss gently to coat, keeping the onion rounds intact. Add the onions to the tray with the squash and roast for 30 minutes, turning the vegetables over halfway (keeping the onions intact), until softened and well browned. Set aside to cool slightly. Turn the oven temperature down to 180C.\n4. Meanwhile, add the remaining tablespoon of oil to a small frying pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the garlic and cook, stirring, until just beginning to colour, about 90 seconds. Add the wine and chopped thyme and cook for 6 minutes, or until reduced by about half. Set aside to cool slightly.\n5. Add the cream, egg, yolks, cornflour, ½ teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper to a large bowl and whisk until smooth. Stir through both cheeses and the cooled wine mixture and set aside.\n6. Lay one sheet of filo out onto a clean work surface and brush liberally with some of the melted butter. Lay the sheet over the prepared cake tin, pushing down to fit into the bottom and sides, allowing the excess to hang over the tin. Repeat with the remaining 6 sheets of filo, rotating them slightly so that the overhang falls at a different angle. Add two-thirds of the squash to the base of the tin along with three of the onion rounds then pour over the cheese mixture. Add the remaining squash and onion rounds and three thyme sprigs, pushing them gently into the cheese layer, but not completely submerging them. Bring in the overhang, scrunching it so it creates roughly a 3 centimeter border around the sides, with the centre exposed. Brush the scrunched up filo with the remaining melted butter. Place onto a baking tray and bake for 30 minutes. Use a tea towel to carefully release the outer round of the tin, discarding the parchment paper around the sides. Return the pie to the oven for another 20 minutes, or until the outsides are golden and cooked through. Set aside to cool for about 20 minutes.\n7. To serve, transfer the pie to a board or serving platter. Spoon over the pickled chilli mixture and garnish with the remaining 2 thyme sprigs.",

There are two ways to char your aubergines: either directly on the flame of your stove top or in a hot oven. The oven takes longer – 55–60 minutes (rather than 15–20 minutes on the stove). For full instructions see Glossary.\n2. Once the flesh has been scooped out of the burnt aubergines it should weigh about 500g. Place in a colander set over a bowl and leave for at least an hour (or overnight, in the fridge), to drain. Once drained, put the aubergine flesh into a medium mixing bowl and, using your hands, pull it apart to create long, thin strands. Add the garlic, lemon, vinegar and 1 teaspoon of salt. Mix to combine and set aside (in the fridge if you are making this a day ahead).\n3. Preheat the oven to 200°C fan.\n4. Put the cauliflower into a large bowl along with the olive oil, coriander seeds, turmeric, ¾ teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Mix well to combine, then spread out on a parchment-lined baking tray. Roast for 30 minutes, until the cauliflower is golden and tender. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool to room temperature.\n5. While the cauliflower is roasting, place all the ingredients for the salsa in a bowl with ½ teaspoon of salt. Mix to combine.\n6. To assemble the dish, spread the aubergine on a serving plate which has a lip and\narrange the cauliflower on top. Spoon over the salsa, sprinkle over the mint and parsley and serve.",

Put the chicken thighs, turmeric, chilli flakes, fish sauce, oil and 1 teaspoon of salt into a large bowl and mix well to combine. Leave to marinate for an hour, or cover and refrigerate for longer (up to overnight). If the latter, remove the chicken thighs from the fridge about 45 minutes before cooking.\n2. Place a large cast-iron sauté pan on a medium-high heat and ventilate your kitchen well. Once hot, add half the chicken thighs, skin side down. Weigh down the thighs with a large saucepan around the same size, so they are well pressed into the pan. Cook for 6–8 minutes, or until the skin is charred and blackened. Remove the top pan and set the chicken thighs aside, then repeat with the remaining thighs. The second batch might blacken faster, so check them at the 5-minute mark. Remove all the chicken, setting it aside, and let the pan cool for 5–10 minutes.\n3. If needed, drain off all but 11⁄2 tablespoons of the fat collected in the pan and return to a medium-high heat. Add the spring onions, using a pair of tongs to coat them in the fat, then put back the chicken thighs, skin side up, and any of their juices, nestling them into the spring onions, along with 90ml of water. Cook for 8 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and cooked through. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and leave to rest for 5 minutes before slicing each thigh into 2cm-wide strips.\n4. While the chicken is cooking, make the caramel and clementine dressing. Heat a medium saucepan on a medium- high heat. Once hot, turn the heat down to medium and sprinkle in the sugar to coat the base – it should immediately start to melt and colour around the sides. Swirl the pan, without stirring, so that all the sugar melts and turns deeply golden, about 11⁄2–2 minutes. Add the ginger and chillies, and stir continuously for 45 seconds, just to take off the spicy edge. Quickly add the vinegar, lime juice and fish sauce, stirring to combine. Cook for 30 seconds, then remove from the heat. Leave to cool for 10 minutes.\n5. Use a small serrated knife to slice the clementines into 1cm- thick rounds, then pull at them gently to halve them (don’t worry if they break apart further). Stir these into the cooled sauce.\n6. To serve, transfer the spring onions to a large platter and top with the chicken and any pan juices, using a spatula to keep each thigh together. Pour the dressing all over, then sprinkle with the coriander. Lastly, squeeze over the lime halves.",

Shave off a long strip of orange peel, avoiding the pith, and put in a small pan. Trim off top and bottom of the orange, then cut down its sides to remove all the skin and pith. Working over a small bowl to catch any juice, cut out the segments by slicing between the membranes. Add the segments to the bowl and set aside.\nAdd the caster sugar to the pan with the peel and add 75ml water. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves – this should take less than a minute. Set aside to cool, then add the orange segments and juices, and the\norange blossom water\n.\nRoughly crush the sesame seeds in a pestle and mortar with a teaspoon of muscovado sugar, and set aside.\nDrain and rinse the barley. Tip it into a medium saucepan with the remaining muscovado sugar, milk, vanilla pod and seeds, citrus zest and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, then turn the heat to medium-low and simmer for an hour, stirring occasionally, until the barley is cooked but still has some bite: if it's becomes very thick, add a little milk towards the end. Leave to cool for five minutes, then remove the vanilla pod and divide between four bowls. Dribble a teaspoon of\ntahini\nover each portion, spoon over the orange segments and syrup, sprinkle with sesame and serve.",

Preheat the oven to 160°C fan. Grease and line the base and sides of a 23cm springform baking tin and set aside.\n2. To make the base, lay out one sheet of filo on a clean work surface. Measure out a third of the butter – this will be used for brushing the sheets – and set the remaining 60g aside for later. Brush the sheet until well coated, then top with the second filo sheet. Continue in this fashion until all the filo and butter has been used up, finishing the last layer with a coating of butter. Transfer the filo stack to a parchment-lined baking tray and bake for about 20 minutes, or until golden and crispy. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for 15 minutes (or longer) before breaking apart into large shards. In two batches, place the shards in a food processor and blitz for about 10 seconds, to form fine crumbs. Place in a medium bowl, then add the nuts to the processor. Blitz for about 20 seconds, until fine but not powdery. Add the nuts to the filo along with the flour, sugar, spices, flaked salt and remaining two-thirds of butter and mix to combine. Tip the mixture into the base of the lined tin and press it down firmly and evenly so that the whole base is covered. Bake for 12 minutes, or until lightly golden. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.\n3. To make the filling, clean out the food processor and add the labneh, ricotta, sugar and salt. Pulse for just a few seconds, to combine. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then add the eggs, egg yolks (the spare whites can be saved for something else), orange zest, orange blossom water, vanilla extract and cornflour. Pulse for about 15 seconds, to combine, then pour the mixture into the cake tin. Bake for 60–70 minutes, or until the cake is beginning to take on some colour around the edges but still has a slight wobble in the middle. Remove from the oven and leave to cool at room temperature for an hour before refrigerating for at least 4 hours or (preferably) overnight.\n4. On the day of serving, preheat the oven to 200°C fan and prepare the topping.\n5. Put the honey,\norange blossom water\n, orange juice and bashed cardamom pods into a small saucepan and place on a medium-high heat. Cook for 4–6 minutes, stirring often, until the mixture has reduced by half and is beginning to form a thin syrup. Spread the apricots out on a parchment-lined baking tray, on their side, and drizzle over half the syrup. Bake for about 8 minutes, turning the apricots over halfway through baking, until completely softened but still retaining their shape. Remove from the oven and set aside for about 30 minutes, until completely cool.\n6. Just before serving (or up to 1 hour, if you want to prepare ahead), release the cake from its tin and transfer to a round serving platter. Top with the apricots – there should not be any overlap – and drizzle with the remaining syrup. The bashed cardamom pods can be used for garnish as well – they look nice – but these are not to be eaten. Scatter over the mint leaves, if using, and serve.",

Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the\nanchos\nin a medium heatproof bowl and add boiling water to cover. Weigh down the chillies with a saucer and leave to soak for 20 minutes. Discard the soaking liquid, then remove the chilli seeds and roughly chop the flesh. Put this in a food processor with the red chillies, chopped onion, garlic, spices, tomato paste, half the oil and a teaspoon of salt, and blitz smooth, scraping down the bowl as you go. Scrape into a bowl and stir in the remaining oil.\n2. Put the turkey giblets in a large, 38cm x 32cm baking tray with a slight lip, add the onion wedges and 500ml water, and top with a large roasting rack.\n3. Pat dry the turkey and season all over with two teaspoons of salt and a good grind of pepper; season the inside, too. Rub half the spice mix over the turkey, including the cavity and in between the breast and skin. Put the turkey on the rack, roast for an hour, then rotate and baste. Repeat every half hour or so, until it has cooked for two hours and 20 minutes, or until the juices run clear (if you have one, it should register 74C on a thermometer); if it gets too dark around the 90-minute mark, loosely cover with foil. Leave to rest (removing any foil) for 15 minutes, so its juices drop into the tray.\nAdvertisement\n4. Once the turkey has rested, set it on a platter or carving board. Discard the giblets from the tray, then add the remaining spice paste, 400ml water and a half-teaspoon of salt to the tray, and scrape up any stuck-on, flavoursome bits. Return to the oven for 15-20 minutes, until bubbling and slightly thickened, spoon into a jug and serve with the turkey.",

Remove from the oven, divide into two piles (20g for the pavlova, 50g for the praline) and set aside to cool.\nReduce the oven temperature to 120°C/100°C Fan/Gas Mark ½ . Cover a large baking tray with baking parchment and trace a circle, about 23cm in diameter, on to the paper. Turn the paper over so the drawn-on side is facing down but still visible.\nFirst make the meringue. Pour enough water into a medium saucepan so that it rises a quarter of the way up the sides: you want the bowl from your electric mixer to be able to sit over the saucepan without touching the water. Bring the water to a boil. Place the egg whites and sugars in the bowl of an electric mixer and whisk by hand to combine. Reduce the heat under the saucepan so that the water is just simmering, then set the mixer bowl over the pan, making sure the water doesn’t touch the base of the bowl. Whisk the egg whites continuously by hand until they are warm, frothy and the sugar is melted, about 4 minutes, then transfer back to the electric mixer with the whisk attachment in place and whisk on a high speed for about 5 minutes, until the meringue is cool, stiff and glossy. Add the cinnamon and whisk to combine.\nSpread the meringue inside the drawn circle, creating a nest by making the sides a little higher than the centre. Place in the oven and bake for 3 hours, then switch off the oven but leave the meringues inside until they are completely cool: this will take about 2 hours. Once cool, remove from the oven and set aside.\nPlace the chocolate into a small heatproof bowl and set it over a small saucepan of simmering water, making sure the base of the bowl is not touching the water. Stir occasionally until melted. Cool slightly, then brush the chocolate inside the meringue nest, leaving the top and sides bare. Do this gently, as the meringue is fairly delicate. Leave to set for about 2 hours.\nMake the praline. Place the 50g toasted almonds on a parchment-lined baking tray (with a lipped edge) and set aside. Put the sugar and water into a small saucepan and place over a medium-low heat, stirring until the sugar has melted. Cook, swirling the pan occasionally, until it turns a dark golden brown. Pour the caramel over the nuts (don’t worry if they’re not all covered) and leave until completely cool and set. Once cool, transfer the praline to the small bowl of a food processor and blitz until fine.\nPlace the cream, mascarpone and blitzed praline in a large bowl and whisk for about 1 minute, until stiff peaks form. Be careful not to over-whisk here – it doesn’t take much to thicken up – or it will split. If this begins to happen, use a spatula to fold a little more cream into the mix to bring it back together. Refrigerate until needed.\nTo assemble, spoon the cream into the centre of the meringue and top with the figs. Warm the honey in a small saucepan and stir through the 20g almonds (or pistachios, as pictured). Drizzle these over the figs, and serve.",

Put the aubergine roll seam side down in the lentil sauce, and repeat with the remaining aubergine slices, spinach and paneer. You should end up with about 18 rolls, all sitting snugly in the sauce. Press the rolls gently into the sauce, but not so far that they are submerged, and bake for 15–20 minutes, until the aubergine is golden-brown on top and the sauce is bubbling. Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 5 minutes.\n6. Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a small pan on a medium-high heat. Add the remaining chilli and curry leaves and fry for a minute, until the curry leaves are crisp and fragrant. Spoon over the aubergine rolls, drizzle over the lime juice and serve with the coriander sprinkled on top.",

Rub it all over the meat and set aside for an hour.\nRinse the ribs well under cold water, gently rubbing off all the salt, and pat dry. Put them into a large saucepan, for which you have a lid, and add the ginger, onion, garlic,\nstar anise\n, cinnamon and peppercorns. Pour over the stock, along with the cooking wine and rice vinegar. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer gently, covered, for an hour.\nLift out the pork and set it aside. If you are not serving them in the next couple of hours, let the ribs cool and store them in the fridge, covered, until ready to use. If you do this, make sure you bring them back to room temperature before you coat them in the glaze before serving.\nStrain the liquid, discarding the onion, garlic and spices, and return it to the pan. Place on a high heat and cook for 30–35 minutes, until the liquid has reduced to just 200ml. Remove from the heat and set aside. Chill if you are not serving the ribs in the next 2 hours.\nRemove the husks from the corn and use them to line the base of a large saucepan or wok which is deep enough to fit a colander or metal steaming basket inside, and for which you have a lid. Add the sprigs of thyme and place the pan on a high heat.\nOnce the husks and thyme begin to smoke, after about 6 minutes, place the colander in the pan and place the corn cobs inside it. Use a lid to seal the pan – then smoke for 5 minutes (or 3, if you are using rice in the base of the pan; see introduction). Remove from the heat and set aside, covered, for another 5 minutes. Remove the lid and set aside to cool.\nStand each corn cob on a chopping board and use a large sharp knife to shave off rows of kernels, cutting from top to bottom. Cut deep enough into the cob so that some of the kernels remain in clusters: this isn’t essential, it just looks good. Set the corn kernels aside and discard the cobs.\nAbout 45 minutes before you are ready to serve, place all the ingredients for the glaze, along with 100ml of the stock reduction, in a large pan. Bring to the boil, then simmer on a medium-high heat for 20–25 minutes, until the liquid has reduced to about 200ml and has the consistency of syrup. Return the pork ribs to the sauce and stir gently so they all get coated. Cook for about 7 more minutes on a medium heat, stirring once or twice, until the ribs are warmed through and sticky.\nJust before serving, finish the salad by placing the lime juice,\nmaple syrup\n, olive oil and chilli in a large bowl with 1 teaspoon of salt. Whisk to combine, then add the corn kernels, herbs and spring onion and mix together. Place two small racks of ribs on each plate – one leaning against the other – and serve with the corn salad alongside.",

Transfer to a bowl, discarding the chilli stem. Once cool enough to handle, peel and discard the skin and stems of the charred aubergines (it’s okay if there is still some skin attached) and add the flesh to the bowl of charred vegetables. You should have roughly 320g of aubergine flesh.\n3. Meanwhile, put the tomato paste, paprika, three-quarters of the garlic and 4 tablespoons of oil into a small saucepan on a medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is fragrant and the tomato paste has turned dark red, about 5 minutes.

Place in a large saucepan with 2.5 litres of water, bring to the boil and simmer for 35 minutes or until soft. Skim off any scum that rises to the surface during cooking.\nUsing a slotted spoon, remove about half the lentils from the cooking liquid and set aside in a bowl. Add a generous pinch of salt to the lentils and water in the pan and liquidise using a stick blender or in a food processor. Return the reserved lentils to the soup.\nNow comes the arduous chopping part of the recipe. Peel the red onions, halve and thinly slice them. Place a frying pan over a medium heat, add the olive oil and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, for 4–5 minutes, until the onions soften and become translucent. Meanwhile, remove and discard the large stems from the Swiss chard. Wash and rinse the leaves thoroughly, then chop them roughly. Do the same with the coriander, leaving a few whole leaves for garnish later, and that’s all the chopping done.\nMix the cooked onions, chard leaves and chopped coriander into the lentil soup and season with the cumin, cinnamon and some salt and pepper to taste. Reheat the soup and simmer gently for 5 minutes.\nIn a pestle and mortar, or using the heel of a large knife, crush the coriander seeds and garlic together. Melt the butter gently in a small saucepan over a medium heat, add the garlic and coriander seeds and fry for 2 minutes, until the garlic starts to colour slightly. Stir this into the soup, remove the pot from the stove and cover with a lid. Leave the soup to infuse for 5 minutes before serving.\nServe garnished with lemon zest and coriander leaves and pass round some sourdough bread and lemon wedges. Make sure everybody squeezes the lemon into their soup.",

Put 2 tablespoons of oil into a large, high-sided ovenproof sauté pan or cast-iron saucepan, for which you have a lid, and place on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the garlic and cook for 90 seconds, until starting to colour.

Preheat the oven to 195°C/175°C Fan/Gas Mark 5. Grease and line the long side and the base of eight small loaf tins with a strip of parchment paper. Allow a 2cm overhang on each side to help you lift out the cakes later on.\n2. Place the Guinness and butter in a medium saucepan over a medium heat. Stir gently until the butter has melted, taking care that it does not come to the boil. Sift the cocoa powder and sugar together into the pan and whisk into the mix, then transfer to a medium bowl.\n3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the soured cream, egg and vanilla, then pour this into the Guinness mix, whisking as you do so. Sift the flour, salt and bicarbonate of soda together into a bowl, then whisk this into the mixture until smooth and combined. Pour the batter into the tins and bake for 20 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes before gently easing them out, using the parchment paper overhang to help you. Gently run a knife around the unlined edges if they are stuck, then place on a wire rack to cool completely.\n4. To make the Baileys cream, whisk together the mascarpone and Baileys using an electric hand-held whisk, if you have one, or by hand. Add the icing sugar and continue to beat on a low speed until the mixture is combined. Increase the speed to medium-high and whisk until the cream is thick enough to spread. Keep in the fridge until ready to serve.\n5. When the cakes are completely cool, make a cut in each cake by running a small paring knife down its centre, leaving 2cm uncut at either end. Transfer the cream to a piping bag fitted with a 1½cm wide nozzle. Gently ease the piping bag into the opening of the cut side of each cake and pipe in the cream until it starts to ooze out.\n6. To make the chocolate ganache, place the chocolate pieces in a food processor, blitz until fine and set aside.\n7. Put the cream and golden syrup in a small pan and place over a medium-high heat. As soon as bubbles begin to appear – just before it comes to the boil – remove from the heat. Get the food processor running again, with the chocolate still inside, and pour in the hot cream in a steady stream. Process for about 10 seconds, then add the butter. Continue to process until the mixture is shiny and smooth.\n8. You can also make the ganache by hand: just make sure the chocolate is chopped fairly finely before you scald the cream and golden syrup and pour it over the chocolate. Stir everything together with a wooden spoon until almost melted, then add the butter. Stir again until the ganache is smooth.\n9. Whether you make it in a machine or by hand, use a rubber spatula to scrape the ganache into a bowl and cover with cling film. Set aside until it has set to the consistency you want, then use it to ice the cake: if you want a thin layer to spread over the cakes, it can be poured over while liquid so that you get an even, light and shiny coating. For a thicker ganache with a spreading consistency, leave it for about 2 hours at room temperature before using a spatula or knife to ice the cakes. Spoon about one tablespoon over each cake: you want it to cover the cut with the cream oozing out. Decorate with chocolate shavings and serve.",

Put the chicken into a large saucepan, for which you have a lid, along with the cinnamon sticks, onion, garlic, 2 litres of water and 2 teaspoons of salt. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, for 70 minutes, or until cooked through. Lift out the chicken and, when cool enough, tear into large bite-size chunks, discarding the skin and bones. Place the chicken in a bowl with the ground cumin and cinnamon and set aside. Strain the stock through a sieve set over a large bowl, discarding the solids. Measure out 850ml and keep warm (save the remainder for another use).\n2. For the rice, put the oil and half the butter into a large saucepan, for which you have a lid, and place on a medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook for 7 minutes, stirring often, until lightly golden. Add the lamb, garlic and spices and cook for 2 minutes more, stirring often, until the lamb is no longer pink. Add the rice, 700ml of the warm stock, 1¾ teaspoons of salt and a good grind of pepper. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover with the lid and cook for 15 minutes. Take off the heat and allow to sit, covered, for 15 minutes more. Add the remaining butter and set aside.\n3. Meanwhile, make the yoghurt sauce by whisking together the yoghurt, garlic, ¾ teaspoon of salt and the remaining 150ml of warm stock in a medium bowl.\n4. Put 2 tablespoons of oil into a large sauté pan on a medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces and cook for 5 minutes, to warm through. Remove from the heat, stir in the lemon juice and parsley and set aside.\n5. Make the garnish by putting the butter into a small frying pan on a medium-high heat. Add the almonds and cook for 3 minutes, stirring, until lightly coloured. Add the pine nuts and cook for another 2 minutes, until golden. Remove from the heat and add the Aleppo chilli.\n6. Spread the rice over a large, round serving platter. Top with the chicken, then pour over half the garlic yoghurt. Finish with the nuts and butter, followed by the picked parsley and pomegranate seeds. Serve the remaining yoghurt alongside.",

Lay the fish on top, pour over the remaining cure, cover with clingfilm and refrigerate for two to three hours.\nMeanwhile, make the cucumber water. Cut off and set aside a quarter of the cucumber. Roughly chop the rest and put in a blender with all the other ingredients and a teaspoon of flaked salt. Blitz on high speed for a minute, until the cucumber has broken down completely, then pass through a fine-mesh sieve, leaving a clear, green liquid; discard the pulp.\nHeat the oil for the aromatics in a medium pan on a medium flame, then gently fry the chillies, garlic, ginger and coriander seeds for five minutes, stirring every now and then, until the garlic is just starting to brown. Add the coriander stalks, fry for a minute or two more, until the garlic is a light golden brown and the chilli aromatic, then use a slotted spoon to transfer the solids to a plate and sprinkle with a little flaked salt. Reserve the oil.\nLift the gurnard from its cure, rinse well, then pat dry. With a very sharp knife, cut the fish against the grain into 5mm-thick slices (a bit like sashimi).\nCut the reserved cucumber in half and scoop out the watery centre. Finely cut the flesh into matchsticks, then divide between four shallow bowls. Pour over the cucumber water and top with slices of the gurnard. Pour a teaspoon of aromatic oil over each and finish with a scattering of the aromatics.",

Lift out the eggs and put them in a bowl placed under cold running water to stop them cooking further. Once the eggs are cool enough to handle, carefully peel off and discard the shells, leaving the eggs intact – a good trick to getting the shells off without damaging the eggs is to crack them gently all over, then put them back in the bowl of cold water: the water will get in between the shell and the membrane, making them easier to peel.\n1. In a small saucepan, toast a tablespoon of the sesame seeds, then transfer to a food processor. Add the prawns, lardons, spring onion, ginger, garlic, soy, rice vinegar and sesame oil, and pulse until well combined.\n2. With wet hands, take about 90g of the prawn mix and flatten it into a thin patty in the palm of your hand. Place a peeled egg in the centre of the patty and gently work the prawn mixture around the egg, pinching and smoothing it as you go, until the egg is fully enclosed. Repeat with the remaining prawn mixture and boiled eggs, then refrigerate the wrapped eggs for 30 minutes.\n3. Combine the remaining sesame seeds and panko breadcrumbs in a shallow bowl. Crack the last egg into a second bowl, and beat. Put the flour in a third bowl.\n4. Take one wrapped egg, gently roll it in the flour, then shake off any excess. Roll it in the beaten egg, until coated, then transfer to the breadcrumb bowl, gently roll it around until evenly coated and put on a large plate. Repeat with the remaining eggs and coatings.\n5. In a small bowl, stir all the dipping sauce ingredients and put to one side.\n6. Have ready a slotted spoon and a rack lined with kitchen paper. In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, heat the oil to 170C. To test that it is up to temperature, drop in a few panko crumbs: if they sizzle immediately, the oil is ready. Turn down the heat to medium-low and carefully lower in two scotch eggs. Fry for five minutes, turning regularly, until golden brown all over, then lift out with a slotted spoon and transfer to the paper-lined rack. Repeat with the remaining eggs in batches of two.\n7.

        "content": "Ingredients\n2 medium egg whites (60g) (save the yolks for another use)\n2 tbsp soy sauce\n2 tbsp cornflour\n4 large chicken breasts, boneless and skinless\n90ml sunflower oil\n1 spring onion, trimmed and finely sliced at an angle (15g)\n5g fresh coriander leaves, roughly chopped\n2 tbsp lemon juice\nsalt and black pepper\nCheat’s preserved lemon:\n1 large unwaxed lemon (150g), ends trimmed and discarded, then cut into ½cm-thick rounds, pips removed (120g)\n60ml lemon juice (from 2–3 lemons)\n2 tsp flaked sea salt\nLemon sauce:\n3 tbsp preserved lemon (see above)\n700ml chicken stock\n25g unsalted butter\n2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed\n1 tbsp caster sugar\n⅛ tsp ground turmeric\n1½ tsp cumin seeds, toasted and roughly crushed with a pestle and mortar\n1½ tbsp cornflour\n2 tbsp lemon juice\n\nMethod\n1. Make the cheat’s preserved lemon by first putting all the ingredients into a small saucepan, for which you have a lid, on a medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to medium-low, cover with the lid and cook for 12–14 minutes, or until the rinds start to look translucent and the juice has reduced by about half. Set aside to cool slightly, then transfer everything to the small bowl of a food processor and blitz until you have a smooth, spreadable paste (similar to lemon curd – add extra water if needed). You’ll make more than you need; see the box below for storage information.\n2. Meanwhile, in a large bowl whisk together the egg whites, soy sauce, cornflour, ½ teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper just until there aren’t any lumps, about 30 seconds. Working with one breast at a time, place the chicken between two pieces of baking parchment and use a meat mallet (or the bottom of a pan) to pound the chicken evenly so it’s just 1cm thick. Transfer to the egg-white bowl and continue with the remaining chicken breasts. Stir everything together gently to coat, then marinate for at least half an hour (or refrigerate overnight if you’re getting ahead).\n3. Make the sauce by first putting 3 tablespoons of the cheat’s preserved lemon, the stock, butter, garlic, sugar, turmeric and half the cumin into a medium saucepan and placing it on a medium-high heat. Bring to the boil, then cook for 15 minutes, stirring a couple of times, until reduced by about a third. Measure out roughly 3 tablespoons of the sauce into a small bowl, add the cornflour and whisk until there are no lumps. Whisk this back into the saucepan and cook for 1 minute on medium-high, whisking continuously, until smooth and thickened slightly. Remove from the heat.\n4. Heat the sunflower oil in a large high-sided frying pan over a medium-high heat. Once hot, fry two of the marinated chicken breasts for 3 minutes per side, or until nicely browned and just cooked through. Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper and continue with the remaining two breasts (be careful as the oil might spit; turn down the heat if needed). Pour off the oil into a bowl (reserving for another use). Add the lemon sauce to the frying pan and bring to a simmer on a medium-high heat. Put back the chicken breasts and cook for just 3 minutes, gently turning them halfway through. Remove from the heat and stir through the 2 tablespoons of lemon juice for the sauce.\n5. Transfer the chicken breasts to a large serving platter with a lip (cutting them into strips, if you like) and pour the sauce all over. Sprinkle with the remaining cumin. In a small bowl, toss together the spring onion, coriander and lemon juice and spoon this all over.",

        "title": "Chicken pastilla",
        "content": "Ingredients\n1.5kg chicken, divided into 6 (or 2 breasts, skin on, and 2 legs and 2 thighs, skin on and on the bone)\n2 tbsp sunflower oil\n2 medium onions, thinly sliced (250g)\n12 garlic cloves, thinly sliced\n4 large plum tomatoes, cut lengthways into 8 long wedges (350g)\n4 long cinnamon sticks\n1 tsp pink peppercorns\n2 whole dried chipotle chillies, or\n1 urfa and 2 dried red chillies, de-seeded\n100ml brandy\n500ml white wine\n500ml chicken stock\n40g dark chocolate (70% cocoa solids), roughly broken\n100g ghee, melted\n250g filo pastry (18-20 sheets)\n20g icing sugar\ncoarse sea salt and black pepper\nCatalan spinach:\n100ml Valdespino sherry vinegar (or another good-quality sherry vinegar)\n100ml brandy\n100g currants\n150g pine nuts, toasted\n11/2 tbsp olive oil\n1 tsp smoked paprika\n3 small shallots, thinly sliced (100g)\n2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced\n200ml double cream\n300g baby spinach\n\nMethod\n1. Season the chicken pieces with 1½ teaspoons of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Heat the sunflower oil in a large sauté pan and place on a high heat. Add half the chicken pieces and sear for 7–8 minutes, turning once halfway through, until deep golden-brown on both sides. Remove from the pan and set aside to cool while you continue with the remaining batch.\n2. Keep the pan on the heat and add the onions and garlic. Cook on a medium-high heat for 15–18 minutes, until the onions are soft, dark and caramelized like jam. Keep a close eye on it towards the end and stir constantly, to make sure it does not catch on the bottom of the pan. Add the tomatoes, cinnamon, peppercorns and dried chillies, along with ½ teaspoon of salt. Continue to cook for another 4–5 minutes, stirring from time to time, then slowly pour over the brandy. Cook for a further 2 minutes, then return the chicken pieces to the pan. Pour over the wine and stock, reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, for 1 hour. Remove the chicken pieces, increase the heat and let the sauce bubble away for 30–35 minutes, until it has reduced by a quarter and has the consistency of caramel. Remove and discard the cinnamon stick and chillies, add the chocolate and cook for 2 minutes, stirring often. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool: you should have about 500ml in the pan.\n3. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, use your hands to pick all the meat off the bones. Return the meat to the sauce, stir gently and set aside.\n4. To make the Catalan spinach, pour the sherry vinegar and brandy into a small saucepan and place on a medium-low heat. Warm through for 5 minutes, then remove from the heat. Stir through the currants and set aside to cool. Mix the pine nuts with 1 teaspoon of oil and the paprika and set aside. Pour the remaining oil into a very large sauté pan, place on a medium-low heat and add the shallots. Cook for about 8 minutes, until soft and lightly coloured. Add the garlic, along with 1 teaspoon of salt, and cook for a further 2 minutes. Add the currant and brandy mix, along with the pine nuts, and cook for 2 more minutes. Pour in the cream, increase the heat and cook for 3 minutes, to reduce the sauce by a quarter. Stir in the spinach and cook for 3–4 minutes, uncovered, for the leaves to wilt and for the liquid to evaporate so that there is about 2 tablespoons left in the pan.\n5. Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas mark 6.\n6. Brush the base and sides of a large deep ovenproof sauté pan – around 25cm wide and 8cm deep – with about a tablespoon of the melted ghee. Brush the first sheet of filo pastry and line the base of the pan. Continue with the next sheet, generously overlapping as you go, and leaving about an 8cm overhang over the edge of the pan with each sheet. Work quite quickly here, so that the pastry does not dry out, brushing each sheet liberally with the melted ghee. Continue until you have used two-thirds of the pastry sheets, then spoon the spinach mixture into the base of the pan. Spread the chicken on top, then continue with the remaining pastry sheets, tucking these ones into the pan, as though making a bed with fitted sheets.\nContinue until all the filo has been used before drawing in the overhanging pastry sheets and sealing these on top of the pie with a final brush of the melted ghee.\n7. Place in the oven and cook for 1 hour, uncovered. Cover with foil and cook for a final 10 minutes, so that the bottom gets golden brown without the top burning. Remove from the oven and set aside for 10 minutes before inverting the pastilla on to a platter. Sprinkle over the icing sugar, through a fine mesh sieve, and serve warm as is. You can also make a mesh pattern on top of the pastilla by heating up a metal skewer with a blow-torch until red hot. Create parallel lines by burning the sugar in straight lines, spaced 2cm apart and then repeating at a 90° angle.",

Divide the cheese mixture between the tins and spread evenly on top – you should be left with 1cm of pastry clear at the top of the tin. Fill with sliced mushrooms, then finish by firmly pressing a whole mushroom skin side down on top. Bake for 25 minutes, until golden-brown and cooked through, including at the base.\nMeanwhile, make the pine nut salsa. Pour the oil into a small saucepan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the pine nuts and fry for one to two minutes, stirring constantly, until golden-brown. Add the lemon juice carefully – it will spit! – then remove from the heat and pour into a small bowl. Set aside to cool, then stir in the parsley.\nOnce the tarts are ready, remove from the oven and set aside for 10 minutes to cool slightly. Serve warm or at room temperature, with the parsley and pine nuts spooned on top and a sprinkle of\nchilli\nto finish.",

Put a griddle pan on a medium-high heat and ventilate the kitchen. Cut the firm tofu lengthwise into 2cm-thick pieces, to give you six slices in total, then cut each piece in half lengthways, to give you 12 slices in total. Grill the tofu in two batches for a minute on each side, until charred, then transfer to the pan of sauce as they’re ready. When all the tofu is in the sauce pan, stir in 100ml cold water and simmer on a medium heat for five minutes.\n4. Meanwhile, toss the carrots with the extra half-teaspoon of oil and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and grill, turning as necessary, for five to 10 minutes (the timing will depend on the size of your carrots), until charred and tender. Gently stir the carrots into the tofu pan, to coat in the sauce.\n5. Spread the tofu cream on a medium serving platter, then arrange the hot tofu and carrot mixture on top.

Preheat the oven to 170°C fan. Line a baking dish about 30cm x 20cm in size with a piece of baking parchment large enough to cover the base and sides, with enough overhang to fold over the pudding as well.\n2. Place a large, non-stick frying pan on a high heat and, once very hot, char a third of the lemon slices on both sides – about 1–2 minutes per side. Continue in this way with the rest.\n3. Put 120ml of\nmaple syrup\nand the scraped-out vanilla pod in the base of your prepared baking dish. Top with the charred lemon slices, spreading out so they cover the entire base, overlapping in places.\n4. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into the bowl of a stand mixer, with the whisk attachment in place, and mix on medium speed to combine. Add the softened butter, eggs, yolk, vanilla seeds, brown sugar, milk and the remaining 3 tablespoons of maple syrup, and mix on medium speed for 2 minutes until combined. The mixture will look as if it’s split a little with some smaller cubes of butter – but that’s okay.\n5. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag, snipping the base, and pipe the mixture evenly on top of the lemons in the baking dish (piping the mixture ensures the lemons don’t move around too much). Gently smooth over the mixture with the back of a spoon. Fold over the excess baking parchment to cover, then wrap the dish tightly in foil.\n6. Place the baking dish in a larger roasting tin (roughly 40cm x 28cm). Pour enough boiling water into the tin to come 3cm up the sides (about 1 litre), then bake for 70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean. Remove the foil, unwrap the top of the pudding and lift out the baking dish from the water. Set aside for 5 minutes before carefully inverting the whole thing on to a platter, removing the parchment paper to expose the lemons.\n7. Towards the last 10 minutes of cooking, make the lemon-maple butter. Put the lemon juice and maple syrup into a small saucepan and bring to a simmer on a medium-high heat. Cook for about 2 minutes, then turn the heat down to low and, when no longer simmering, gradually add the butter cubes a little at a time, whisking with each addition until incorporated. Don’t let the mixture boil at all – you should be left with an emulsified sauce. Remove from the heat.\n8. Drizzle one-third of the lemon-maple butter all over the pudding and serve warm, with the extra maple butter and crème fraîche alongside.",

First make the dough. Put the yeast, sugar and milk into a small bowl and mix to combine. Set aside for 5 minutes, until it starts to get frothy.\n2. Meanwhile, put the flour and ½ teaspoon of salt into the bowl of a freestanding mixer, with the dough hook in place. Mix on a low speed, then slowly pour in the yeast mixture. Add the melted butter and continue to mix for about a minute.\n3. Add the egg, then increase the speed to medium and leave for 5 minutes, for the dough to get well kneaded. Using your hands, scrape the dough into a ball: it will be slightly sticky and elastic. Place it in a lightly oiled bowl, turning it a couple of times so that the dough gets well greased. Cover the bowl with a clean tea towel and leave to rest in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until almost doubled in size.\n4. Put the sugar and cinnamon for the filling into a small bowl. Mix well to combine, then set aside.\n5. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a large rectangle, about 35 x 50cm. Drizzle the\ntahini\nover the dough, then, using the back of a spoon or a spatula, spread it out evenly, leaving 1cm clear of tahini at both the shorter ends. Sprinkle the sugar mixture evenly over the tahini and leave for 10 minutes, until the sugar looks all wet.\n6. Starting from one of the long sides, roll the dough inwards to form a long, thin sausage. Trim away about 2cm from each end, then slice the dough into 10 equal pieces: they should each be just over 4½cm long. Sit each piece upright, so that its cut side is facing upwards, then, using your hands, gently flatten out to form an 8cm-wide circle. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rest for 15 minutes.\n7. Preheat the oven to 160°C fan.\n8. Transfer each roll of dough to a large parchment-lined baking tray, spaced 2–3cm apart. Brush all over – just the top and sides, not the base – with the egg yolk, sprinkle with sesame seeds, and bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 18 minutes, or until cooked through and golden. Remove from the oven and set aside for about 20 minutes – you don’t want them to be piping hot – then serve.",

Put the cream in a small, heavy-based saucepan and place over a medium-low heat. Cook until it is just starting to simmer, then pour the hot cream over the chocolate. Leave to sit for 3 minutes, for the chocolate to soften, then stir gently until the chocolate is melted and fully combined. Cover with cling film and refrigerate for 1 hour until completely cold.\nTo cook the strawberries, place the strawberries, sugar and lemon juice in a small saucepan (along with the empty vanilla pod) and mix well. Bring to the boil over a medium heat and cook for 4–5 minutes, stirring regularly, until the sugar has melted and the mixture has thickened. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.\nPreheat the oven to 170°C/150°C Fan/Gas Mark 3. Line a large baking tray with baking parchment and place eight 8cm cake rings, ungreased and unlined, on top and set aside. If making this in a 20cm round springform tin, you don’t need the baking tray, but you will need to line the bottom of the tin with baking parchment.\nPut enough water into a medium saucepan so that it rises about 5cm up the sides: you want the bowl from your electric mixer to be able to fit in the saucepan and sit over the water without actually touching it. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.\nTo make the sponge, place the eggs, sugar, vanilla and lemon zest in the bowl of an electric mixer and place the bowl on top of the saucepan of simmering water, making sure (again) that the bottom of the bowl is not touching the water. Whisk continuously by hand for about 5 minutes, until the mixture is frothy, creamy and warm. Remove the bowl and place it on the electric mixer with the whisk attachment in place. Whisk on a high speed until the mixture has tripled in volume and is no longer warm.\nWhile the mix is beating in the mixer, melt the butter and set aside to cool. Combine the flour and salt in a bowl and sift it twice. When the egg mixture has tripled in volume and is no longer warm, sift half the flour (yes, a third sift!) directly over the mixture and gently fold it in with a large rubber spatula. Sift the remaining flour over the mixture and fold in again. Now drizzle the cooled, melted butter down the sides of the bowl. Fold in gently and swiftly to incorporate.\nSpoon the mixture into the cake rings – it should be filled two-thirds of the way up the sides – and bake for 15–18 minutes (or 25 minutes if baking one large cake), or until the cakes are a light golden brown and the sponge springs back when lightly pressed in the middle. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for 20 minutes, in the rings, before using a small knife to remove them: take a bit of care here, to prevent the cakes tearing or sticking to the sides. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\nWhen ready to assemble, place the white chocolate cream in the bowl of an electric mixer with the whisk attachment in place. Add the extra 120ml cream and whip on a medium-high speed for about 30 seconds until combined and thick. It should just hold on the whisk – it can over-whip very quickly, so be careful.\nCut the cakes horizontally across the centre and spread the cooked strawberries on the cut side of the bottom piece (discard the vanilla pod). Spoon half of the white chocolate cream on top, followed by the sliced strawberries, followed by the remaining white chocolate cream. Finish with the top half of the sponge. If you have made one large cake, take care when slicing it in half; you’ll need to support it underneath when lifting it back on top of the cream and strawberries. If you have a cake lifter or jumbo cookie spatula, now is the time to use it! Dust with icing sugar and serve.",

Cook for 20 minutes, then add a teaspoon and three-quarters of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook for another 10-15 minutes, until the chickpeas are quite soft but not falling apart.\n4. Meanwhile, put the tamarind in a heatproof bowl, pour over 250ml boiling water and leave to sit for 15 minutes. Using your hands, squeeze the pulp to release the seeds and extract as much flavour as possible, then strain through a sieve set over a second bowl and push down the solids, scraping them to push out as much liquid as you can; you should be left with about 140ml thick tamarind liquid. Discard the solids.\n5. Add the tamarind liquid to the chickpeas and cook on a medium heat for seven minutes more, until the chickpeas are nice and soft, and the liquid has reduced slightly, then stir through the chopped coriander.\n6. Drain the grated tomatoes in a sieve, discarding any excess liquid, then put the pulp in a bowl and combine with the remaining garlic, remaining three tablespoons of oil, half a teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of black pepper.\n7. Stir half the grated tomato mixture into the chickpeas, then divide the stew between six bowls. Top with the remaining grated tomato, cumin and a few coriander leaves, and serve warm.",

Bring to a simmer on a medium-high heat, skimming the scum from the surface as needed, then turn the heat down to medium-low, cover with the lid and simmer from anywhere between 30 and 50 minutes. This will differ greatly depending on your chickpeas, so check them at the 20-minute mark. Towards the last 15 minutes of cooking time, salt the water nicely and add the cumin. Cook your chickpeas until they are very soft.\nUsing a slotted spoon or spider, agitate your chickpeas, giving them a gentle shake in the water, allowing the skins to be released and rise to the surface. Discard the skins (don’t worry too much if you don’t catch them all). Skip to step 5.\nIf using tinned chickpeas, spread them out between two tea towels and use your hands to vigorously rub the towels together for a few minutes. Don’t press down too hard on the chickpeas; you don’t want to crush them. Lift the top towel, to see how you’re doing – the friction should have caused the chickpea skins to be released. Discard the skins.\nPut the tinned (and now peeled) chickpeas into a saucepan with enough water to cover, 1 teaspoon of salt and a pinch of cumin. Simmer for 15 minutes, until soft.\nDrain the chickpeas over a bowl, saving the water. Put the warm chickpeas into a food processor with 120g of\ntahini\n, the garlic, lemon juice, a couple of ice cubes (25g worth), 2 tablespoons of reserved chickpea water and a good pinch of salt. Blitz until smooth(ish), then check on your hummus. You might need more tahini, garlic, lemon and salt and very likely more chickpea water. Add a bit of each as you need. Don’t be shy about adding more tahini – each brand differs and may require you to use more. Blitz the hummus until very smooth, a few minutes at least. Don’t worry about the hummus being too loose; it will thicken as it sits.\nWhen ready, spread the hummus in a shallow bowl, creating a well in the centre. (If not serving right away, store in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 2 days.) Top with a generous glug of olive oil, then personalise your hummus as you wish. We sometimes add herbs, toasted nuts or\nrose harissa\n, but these are just suggestions. Once you get the base right, hummus knows no bounds.\nTOPPINGS\nMarinated mushrooms\n1. Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas 6. Drizzle the garlic heads with a teaspoon of oil and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Wrap tightly in foil and roast for 40 minutes, until the cloves are soft and golden brown. Discard the foil and, when cool enough to handle, squeeze out the cloves; discard the papery skin.\n2. While the garlic is roasting, prepare the mushrooms. Put the garlic, oil, lemon zest and juice, thyme and maple syrup into a large bowl with a teaspoon of flaked salt and a generous grind of black pepper. Heat a large griddle pan on a high heat, then lay in the mushrooms, well spread out (depending on the size of your grill, you may need to cook them in batches), and grill, turning often, for about eight minutes, until the mushrooms have dark char-marks on all sides. Add the griddled mushrooms to the bowl with the oil mixture and stir to combine.\n3. Grill the chilli in the same pan for four minutes, until fragrant, then roughly chop and add to the bowl. Leave to marinate for an hour or two.\n4. Spread the hummus in the base of a shallow bowl, and make a large well in the centre with the back of a spoon. Stir the dill and parsley into the mushrooms, then spoon into the well, with all the oil and aromatics.\nWarm chickpeas and garlic\n1. Heat the oil in a small saucepan over a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the garlic and fry for 1 1/2 -2 minutes or until lightly golden. Strain the fried garlic through a sieve set over a heatproof bowl to catch the oil. To the oil, stir in the chickpeas, a pinch of salt and the fried garlic.\n2. Spread the hummus out onto a shallow bowl and use your spoon to create a well in the centre. Spoon the chickpea mixture into the well and then sprinkle with the paprika and parsley.\nTahini and green shattah\n1. Make the tahini sauce. Add the\ntahini\n, garlic, lemon juice and water to a small bowl and use a whisk to combine. It'll look split at first, but will eventually come together as you whisk it. Season with a pinch of salt and add a bit more water if needed so that you have a thick yet pourable consistency.\n2. Add the\nshattah\nto a separate small bowl and stir in the olive oil.\n3. Spread the hummus out onto a shallow bowl and use your spoon to create a well in the centre. Pour the tahini sauce into the well then spoon over the shattah. Lastly, top with the pine nuts.",

Preheat the oven to 240°C/220°C fan/gas mark 9.\n2. Spread the thyme, garlic cloves, lemongrass and ginger over the base of a large high-sided roasting tray, measuring 32cm x 24cm. Lay the pork belly on top of the herbs, skin side up, and use kitchen paper to pat the meat dry very well. Rub the lemon all over the pork skin, squeezing the juice out as you rub. Set aside to dry for 10 minutes before sprinkling half the salt evenly all over the skin. Place in the oven and roast for an hour, until the crackling is semi-hard and the salt has turned grey: the aromatics will be very crisp and charred at this point but don’t worry: this is normal.\n3.Remove from the oven and scrape off and discard the salt. Spread the remaining half of the salt evenly all over the skin, then return it to the oven. Cook for another half an hour, until the crackling is solid and hard. Remove the tray from the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 190°C/170°C fan/gas mark 5. If a bubble has formed on the skin, insert a small knife and gently push it down to let out the air. Pour the wine into the roasting tray, taking care not to touch or wet the sides or skin of the pork belly, followed by 400ml of water. Return the tray to the oven and cook for another hour. Reduce the heat to 120°C/100°C fan/gas mark 1/2 and cook for a final hour. Remove from the oven and set aside to rest for 30 minutes.\n4. While the pork is roasting for the last hour, prepare all the ingredients for the butternut squash and the salsa, and as soon as it is out of the oven increase the oven temperature to 220°C/200°C fan/gas mark 7.\n5. Mix the squash with the 2 tablespoons of olive oil and spread it out on a large baking tray. Roast in the oven for 30 –40 minutes, until cooked. Transfer to a large bowl, add the butter and use a potato masher to crush the squash – don’t over-mash it, as you want some texture to remain – before stirring in the rice vinegar,\nmiso\nand 1 teaspoon of salt and a grind of black pepper. Keep warm.\n6. Mix together all the ingredients for the salsa in a medium bowl, along with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a grind of black pepper.\n7. Transfer the rested pork to a chopping board. The liquid left in the baking tray can either be discarded – it’s done its work on the pork – or used as a base for a soup or a stew. Discard the herbs from the pork and use a metal spoon or pastry brush to scrape or brush off any excess salt from the skin, then use a large serrated knife to slice the meat into evenly- sized rectangles, 3–4cm thick. If you want to remove the ribs before you slice the meat you can pull and twist them out, but otherwise you can slice between them and serve the meat on the ribs.\n8. To serve, divide the warm crushed squash between the plates and place a slice of pork on top. Spoon the salsa alongside or on the side and serve.",

Grease the six or twelve moulds (see introduction) very well with butter and line with squares of baking parchment, cut large enough so that the sides rise a couple of centimetres above the muffin tray.\nPlace all the ingredients for the salad, apart from the beetroot and apple, in a medium bowl. Mix well and set aside until ready to serve.\nPlace each cob perpendicular on your chopping board and use a large sharp knife to shave off the kernels: you should have about 500g. Discard the cob and transfer the kernels to a food processor, along with the shallots and garlic. Pulse for 3–4 seconds, until the mixture is roughly processed but has not turned to a wet purée. Add the fennel seeds, cumin, celery seeds, tarragon, baking powder, butter and egg yolks, along with 1½ teaspoons of salt and a very good grind of black pepper. Blitz a few more times, to combine – some of the corn kernels will still be whole – then transfer to a medium bowl. Fold the flour in by hand and set aside.\nPlace the egg whites in a separate medium bowl and whisk to form firm peaks. Fold a third of the whites gently into the corn mixture – you don’t want to overwork it – and then, once it has incorporated, continue with the next third and then the next. Once fully incorporated, divide the mixture between the moulds and then insert a chunk of feta into each. Push it halfway down the corn mixture: the cakes will puff up around the cheese when they cook. Bake for 25–40 minutes, depending on the size of your moulds, until the cakes have risen and are golden and fluffy: the mixture will still be a bit wet at this point. Remove from the oven and set aside for 10 minutes before lifting them out of the tray.\nAdd the beetroot and apple to the salad dressing just before serving and mix together gently. Serve the warm cakes with the salad alongside, sprinkled with the remaining fennel seeds and the basil leaves.",

Preheat the oven to 190°C/170°C fan/gas mark 5.\n2. Place the chocolate and butter for the ganache in a heatproof bowl and place over a saucepan half full of simmering water: take care that the water is not touching the base of the bowl. Keep on the heat for about 5 minutes, stirring and folding the mixture every now and then, until the chocolate is melted and shiny. Remove from the heat and set aside until completely cool.\n3. Place the egg, egg yolks and sugar in an electric mixer bowl and whisk for 5–6 minutes, until thick, light and foamy. In stages, carefully fold the egg into the chocolate by hand, taking care not to overwork the mixture, then transfer to a lightly greased and parchment-lined loaf tin, measuring about 22cm × 8cm. Place in the oven and bake for about 10 minutes, until the surface is opaque but the middle has a slight wobble. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. Cover and refrigerate until set, preferably overnight. You don’t want it to be too firm when serving, so remove it from the fridge 2 hours before serving.\n4. To make the spice mix, place the coriander seeds, peppercorns, cinnamon stick, star anise and cardamom pods in a frying pan and toast for 2–3 minutes, until fragrant. Transfer to a spice grinder or a pestle and mortar and blitz until completely fine. Transfer to a medium bowl, mix in the sugar and hazelnuts and set aside.\n5. Mix together the crème fraîche and icing sugar and keep in the fridge until ready to use.\n6. To make the orange oil, mix together the orange zest and olive oil and set aside.\n7. To serve, arrange the hazelnut spice mix in a straight line down the middle of eight plates. Scoop a dessertspoon-size portion of chocolate on to each plate (dipping the spoon in hot water will help keep things neat) and place on an angle across the nuts. Place a spoonful of crème fraîche next to the chocolate and drizzle the orange oil on top. Finish with a tiny pinch of salt and serve at once.",

First make the dough. Put the flour, sugar and salt in a small bowl and whisk to combine. Add the butter cubes, but without mixing them in, then freeze the bowl and its contents for 30 minutes.\n2. Tip the chilled mixture into a food processor and pulse a few times, until the cold butter breaks down to the size of peas. Add the water and vinegar, and pulse a few times more, just until the dough starts to come together. Transfer to a clean work surface and use your hands to bring it together into a cohesive dough, working quickly so it keeps nice and cold (that’s the secret to ensuring a light, flaky galette pastry). Shape into a rough round, wrap tightly to make it airtight, then refrigerate for at least two hours or overnight.\n3. Heat the oven to 210C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Put the dough on a well-floured surface and roll it out into a 35cm-diameter circle. Carefully lift this on to a lined baking tray and fold about 1½cm of the pastry’s edge over on itself all the way round. Repeat, so it now has a double folded rim. Crimp decoratively all around the edge, if you wish, then spread the spiced apple butter (or apple sauce) evenly over the base, avoiding the rim. Refrigerate the dough while you make the filling.\n4. Using a mandoline or sharp knife, finely slice the apples into 2mm-thick rounds. Put in a bowl with the lemon juice and toss to coat. Arrange the slices on top of the galette base in concentric circles, overlapping them slightly, until the base is completely covered. Brush the apples with the melted butter, then sprinkle with the sugar. Bake for 30 minutes, then turn the tray around and turn down the heat to 190C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Bake for another 20-25 minutes, or until golden and the apples are catching a little at the edges. Transfer to a rack and leave to cool slightly.\n5. Put the jam and calvados in a small saucepan and heat gently to warm through, whisking to combine. Brush this mixture evenly over the apples, then slide the galette on to a serving plate or board. Serve warm or at room temperature, with the creme fraiche alongside and some caramel sauce, if you like.",

Place on a medium-high heat, bring to a light simmer and then cover the pan and transfer to the oven. Cook for 4 to 4½ hours, depending on size, until the meat is completely tender. Once done remove the ribs from the stock (you can use the stock for soups or sauces). Remove and discard the bones and excess fat leaving the meat in large chunks.\nWhile the beef is cooking make the marinade. Place all of the ingredients in the small bowl of a food processor. Add 1 teaspoon of salt and blitz to form a very smooth paste. Transfer to a large non-reactive bowl, add the beef meat and mix well so that the meat is well coated. Cover and leave in the fridge overnight to marinate.\nThe next day, preheat the oven to 200C. Place a ridged griddle pan on a high heat and, when it is starting to smoke, add the beef pieces (you can obviously also do this on a barbecue outdoors). Grill for 2 minutes, turning so that all sides get some colour and smoke. Transfer to a baking tray and place in the oven for about 12 minutes, until the meat is warmed through.

Melt the butter in a medium saucepan on medium/low heat. Add the next seven ingredients, along with 75ml of water, and increase the heat to medium/high. Bring the mixture to a boil, whisking regularly to avoid it catching on the bottom of the pan. Measure the bicarbonate of soda into a large bowl and set aside. As soon as the butter/sugar mixture has come to a boil, carefully pour it onto the bicarbonate of soda, whisking as you go, and taking care as it will bubble up a fair bit. Leave to cool to room temperature and then place in the fridge, covered, until cold, about 2-3 hours or overnight.\n2. Once the butter/sugar mix is completely cold, transfer it to the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment in place. Add the flour and mix on low speed until the dough is smooth and there are no dry bits of flour remaining, about 5 minutes. Transfer the dough to a clean work surface and shape into a smooth flat disc. Wrap tightly in clingfilm and place in the fridge overnight.\n3. Preheat the oven to 180c fan. Remove the dough from the fridge and leave out at room temperature for about 15-30 minutes to soften slightly. Lightly flour a clean work surface as well as the dough. Lightly flour a rolling pin and roll the dough out to a thickness of about 4mm, using as much flour as needed to stop it from sticking.\n4. Use the templates to cut out the gingerbread house components and place them onto two or three large 40cmx33cm parchment lined baking trays. They will spread a bit during baking so make sure you leave enough space in between. Bake in batches if your baking trays are smaller. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the edges start to colour. The smaller pieces will bake quicker so keep an eye on them. Leave to cool completely on a wire rack, about 30 minutes. You can reroll any remaining dough scraps to make gingerbread men or other festive shapes!\n5. If making the royal icing, place all the ingredients into the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment in place. Whip on medium speed for about 5 minutes until the icing is light and fluffy. Keep the icing covered with a clean damp cloth at all times to prevent it drying up.\n6. Once the gingerbread has completely cooled you are ready to assemble! Use the icing to glue the gingerbread components together to make the house, as well as for sticking on the sweets and any other decorative purposes such as snow and icicles etc.\nOnce built, the house will keep for several weeks!",

Once hot, fry the onions, stirring from time to time, until softened and lightly browned – about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger, cumin, cardamom and a teaspoon and a half of cinnamon, and cook for two minutes more, until fragrant.\n2. Add the chicken, two teaspoons of salt and a generous grind of pepper, and cook for about five minutes, to sear lightly, then pour in the stock, bring to a boil and turn the heat to medium-low.

        "content": "Ingredients\n50g blanched almonds\n300g caster sugar\n25ml water\n½ tsp ground cinnamon\n1/8 tsp ground cloves\nfinely grated zest of 1 large orange\n(1 tbsp)\n¼ tsp flaky sea salt\n150g egg whites (from 4 large eggs)\n\nMethod\nPreheat the oven to 190°C/170°C Fan/Gas Mark 5.\nSpread the almonds out on a small baking tray and roast in the oven for 5–7 minutes, until lightly browned. Set aside to cool. Line two large baking trays with baking parchment and set aside.\nPlace 50g of sugar in a small saucepan with the water and stir to combine. Cook over a high heat for about 4 minutes, until it has turned a light golden brown; do not stir, just gently shake the pan to help the sugar dissolve. Add the almonds and cook for 1 minute, so the nuts are coated and the caramel turns dark, without burning. Pour the mixture on to one of the lined baking trays and set aside until cool.\nOnce cool, break the praline into smaller pieces, place in a food processor and blitz to form a rough powder. Remove from the machine and place in a shallow bowl with the spices, orange zest and salt. Mix, then set aside until ready to use.\nSpread the remaining sugar out on the second lined baking tray and place in the oven for 7 minutes, until the sugar is hot. Remove from the oven and reduce the temperature to 130°C/110°C Fan/Gas Mark ¾. As soon as the sugar is out of the oven, place the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer with the whisk attachment in place, and whisk on a high speed until they begin to froth up. Carefully add the hot sugar to the whisking egg whites, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue beating for 7–8 minutes until the mixture is completely cold. At this point it should be silky and thick and keep its shape when you lift a little bit from the bowl.\nLine the two large baking trays once again with baking parchment. Use an extra-large serving spoon to scoop up some meringue, and use another large spoon to help shape it into a rough ball the size of a large apple. Sprinkle some praline over half the meringue ball, then place on the baking tray. Repeat with the rest of the mixture, spacing the balls about 10cm apart to allow room for increase in size.\nPlace the meringues in the oven for 2–2½ hours. Check that they are done by lifting them from the tray and gently tapping to make sure the outside is completely firm and the centre is only a little soft. Remove from the oven and leave on the tray to cool completely.",

        "title": "Mont Blanc tarts (SWEET pg 235)",
        "content": "Ingredients\nFlaky pastry:\n200g plain flour\n120g unsalted butter, fridge-cold, cut into 1cm dice\n30g caster sugar\n¼ tsp salt\n½ tsp white wine vinegar\n3 tbsp ice-cold water\nCandied pecans:\n1 tbsp\nmaple syrup\n1 tbsp liquid glucose\n1 tbsp caster sugar\n120g pecan halves\n1/8 tsp flaky sea salt\nFilling:\n60g dark cooking chocolate (70% cocoa solids)\n320g sweetened chestnut spread (we use Clement Faugier; whichever brand you use, just make sure that it is not the unsweetened variety)\nvanilla whipped cream\n300ml double cream\n1 tbsp icing sugar\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n½ tsp brandy\n\nMethod\n1. For the pastry, place the flour, butter, sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Blitz a few times, until it is the consistency of fine breadcrumbs, then add the vinegar and water. Continue to work for a few seconds, then transfer to your work surface. Shape into a ball and flatten into a disc, wrap in cling film and set aside in the fridge for at least 1 hour (or up to 3 days).\n2. Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C Fan/Gas Mark 6.\n3. To line the tart cases, allow the dough to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes (if it has been in the fridge for more than a few hours) and place on a lightly floured work surface. Roll out the dough to about 3mm thick and cut out eight circles, 14cm wide. Re-roll the dough, if necessary, to get eight circles. Transfer one circle at a time to the 8–9cm wide and 2–3cm deep fluted tins and gently press the pastry into the corners of the tart tin: you want it to fit snugly and for there to be a decent amount of pastry hanging over the edge of the tart case, as the pastry can shrink a little when baked. Place in the fridge for 30 minutes to rest.\n4. To blind bake the tart cases, line the pastry bases with baking parchment or paper liners and fill with baking beans. Bake for 18 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown at the edges. Remove the beans and paper and cook for another 8 minutes, or until the base is golden brown. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool completely in the tray. Once cool, trim the pastry (so that it can be removed from the tray) and set aside until ready to fill.\n5. Increase the oven temperature to 210°C/190°C Fan/Gas Mark 6. Line a baking tray (with a lipped edge) with baking parchment and set aside.\n6. To make the candied pecans, put the\nmaple syrup\n, glucose and sugar into a small saucepan and place over a low heat. Stir gently until the sugar has melted, then add the pecans and salt. Stir so that the nuts are coated in syrup, then tip the nuts on to the lined baking tray. Place in the oven for about 8 minutes, or until the syrup is bubbling around the nuts. Remove the tray from the oven and set aside until completely cooled. When the nuts are cooled, the glaze should be completely crisp; if not, return them to the oven for a few more minutes. Once cooled, break or roughly chop the nuts into 0.5cm pieces and set aside until ready to use.\n7. Make the filling when you are ready to assemble. Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure that the base of the bowl is not touching the water. Stir occasionally until melted, then use a pastry brush to line the inside of each case with the chocolate. Set aside for about 30 minutes, to set, then fill with enough chestnut spread so that it rises about halfway up the sides of the tart cases.\n8. For the vanilla whipped cream, pour the cream into the bowl of an electric mixer with the whisk attachment in place. Add the icing sugar, vanilla extract and brandy and whisk on a high speed for 1 minute, or until medium-soft peaks form.\n9. Divide the whipped cream between the tarts, so that it is slightly domed on top of the chestnut spread. Sprinkle the candied pecans generously on top – you might have a tablespoon or two left over, but these can be saved to munch on, to sprinkle over your next bowl of breakfast granola or porridge, or to use in the Knickerbocker Glory (see page 293) – and serve.",

Once hot, add half of the mushrooms and fry for a few minutes, or until just cooked; try not to move them much so you get golden-brown patches on their surface. Remove from the pan, and repeat with the rest of the mushrooms and oil. Off the heat, return all the mushrooms to the pan and add the garlic, tarragon, thyme, truffle oil and some salt and pepper. Keep warm.\nBring the stock to the boil in a saucepan. Slowly stir in the polenta, then reduce the heat to the minimum and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. The polenta is ready when it leaves the sides of the pan but is still runny. If you are using instant polenta this shouldn’t take more than 5 minutes; with traditional polenta it could take up to 50 minutes (if it seems to dry out, add some more stock or water but just enough to keep it at a thick porridge consistency).\nPreheat the grill to high. When the polenta is ready, stir in the Parmesan, butter, rosemary and half the chervil. Season with salt and pepper. Spread the polenta over a heatproof dish and top with the Taleggio. Place under the grill until the cheese bubbles. Remove, top with the mushrooms and their juices, and return to the grill for a minute to warm up. Serve hot, garnished with the remaining chervil.",

If your pan isn’t big enough to hold all the water, keep some back and add it later, once some of the water has been absorbed.\n3. Cook on a medium-high heat for an hour – the dal should be rapidly simmering – stirring often and skimming any scum off the top with a slotted spoon.\n4. For the grilled tomato salsa, heat a griddle pan on a high heat. Add the tomatoes and char for 20 minutes, turning throughout, until the skin is blackened and blistered all over.

Preheat the oven to 220°C fan.\n2. Wrap the potatoes individually in foil and bake for 1 hour or until cooked through. While still warm, peel the potatoes, discarding the skin, and mash them in a bowl using a potato ricer or masher to get about 230g of smooth mash.\n3. Once the potatoes are in the oven, place the swede on a parchment-lined baking tray. Toss with ½ tablespoon of olive oil, cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes or until cooked through (you can roast the swede at the same time as the potatoes). Transfer to a food processor with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and blitz until smooth with no lumps – you may need to stop and scrape down the sides a few times. You should have about 320g of swede. Add to the bowl of mash along with the egg yolk and ¼ teaspoon of salt and mix well to combine, then fold in the flour until well combined with no lumps. Transfer the dough to a piping bag and refrigerate for an hour or until well chilled.\n4. Snip the end off the piping bag to give you an opening about 2cm wide. Fill a medium pot with 1½ litres of water, add 2 teaspoons of salt and bring to the boil, then lower the heat to medium-high so the water is simmering gently. Cook the gnocchi (homemade or shop-bought – see the introduction) in about five batches so as not to overcrowd the pan. Pipe 3cm pieces of gnocchi into the water, using a small sharp knife to cut off each piece of dough. Cook for 2–3 minutes, or until the gnocchi float to the top. Lift out the cooked gnocchi with a slotted spoon and place them on a parchment-lined tray, spaced apart. Once all the gnocchi are cooked, drizzle them with 2 teaspoons of oil and refrigerate for 20 minutes until slightly chilled – this will help them to set and keep their shape when you fry them.\n5. Pour the stock into a large sauté pan on a medium-high heat and cook for 12–14 minutes, or until reduced to 200ml. Add the morning glory (or spinach) and cook for 2 minutes until tender, then remove from the pan and set aside, leaving most of the liquid in the pan. Return the pan to a medium heat and whisk in the miso, lime juice, ginger and butter, then cook for 3 minutes, whisking until the butter melts and the sauce is smooth and slightly thickened. Take care not to let it boil, as it will split.\nRemove the pan from the heat and set aside.\n6. Heat the remaining 1½ tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat. Once it’s very hot, add half the gnocchi and fry for 1–2 minutes on each side, or until nicely browned all over. Transfer to a plate and continue with the other half. Add the cooked gnocchi and morning glory (or spinach) to the pan of sauce, return to a medium-high heat and gently heat through for a minute or two.\n7. Divide between four plates, sprinkle with the lime zest, spring onions and sesame seeds, and serve at once.",

Put the pine nuts in the small bowl of a food processor, blitz until fine and transfer to a medium bowl.\n2. Spoon the ricotta into the middle of a clean tea towel, draw up the edges of the towel to enclose the cheese, and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Add the ricotta to the pine nuts, then mix in the whole eggs, egg white, nutmeg, baking powder, 50g of parmesan, half the semolina, half a teaspoon of salt and a quarter-teaspoon of pepper.

Turn down the heat to medium-high, so the water is at a steady simmer, then drop in half the gnudi and wait for them to rise to the surface – about a minute or two. Once they’ve bobbed up, simmer for three minutes more. Use a slotted spoon to scoop them out and transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining gnudi.\n5. Put a very large sauté pan on a medium-high heat. Add the butter and oil and, once the butter is frothing, the lemon zest, garlic and sage. Cook for two to four minutes, stirring continuously, until the garlic starts to turn golden and the lemon skin crisps up a bit. Stir in the chilli, lemon juice and gnudi, and cook for 90 seconds, just to warm through; stir very gently, otherwise the dumplings will break up. Serve in shallow bowls, making sure each portion gets plenty of skin and garlic, and top with a sprinkle of parmesan.",

Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 10 minutes, until just cooked. Drain and set aside.\nWipe the pan dry and return it to a medium heat with the 15g of ghee. When melted, add the 8 stems of curry leaves and mustard seeds and fry for 2 minutes, until fragrant. Add the onion and garlic and fry for another 3 or 4 minutes, until starting to soften. Add the turmeric, tomatoes and cooked potatoes, stir to coat the potatoes with the spices, then cook for a minute or so before adding the butter, 1 teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Cook for a final minute, then set aside and just warm up when you need it.\nTo make the rasam, pour 900ml of boiling water over the tamarind and set aside for 30 minutes, for the pulp to soften and disintegrate in the water. Use your hands to break up and dissolve the pulp, then strain through a fine mesh sieve and discard the seeds. Put the sunflower oil into a large pot and place on a medium heat. Add the onions and garlic and fry for 4–5 minutes, stirring from time to time, until starting to soften. Add the garam masala, 12 stems of curry leaves and chillies and fry for another minute before adding the tomatoes. Pour over the tamarind water, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer very gently for 15 minutes; take care that it does not come to the boil, as this will cause the tamarind pulp to split. Add 2 teaspoons of salt, stir through and set aside. You can leave this to infuse for a few hours and then, when ready to serve, there are two options. For a more formal look, strain the rasam for a clear broth; for a more rustic and informal look, you can skip the straining and keep the onion, garlic, curry leaves and chillies in the pot. Either way, you’ll need to return it to the stove and warm it through before serving.\nTo cook the fish, place a large frying pan on a medium heat and add the ghee. Use 1½ teaspoons of salt to sprinkle over the skin side of all 6 fish, along with a grind of black pepper. When the ghee has melted, add the fish to the pan, skin-side down: you might need to do this in two batches so as not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for 3–4 minutes, until crisp and golden-brown. Use another 1½ teaspoons of salt to sprinkle on the flesh side of the fish, along with some more black pepper, then flip the fish over and cook for a final minute. Remove from the heat and drizzle with the lemon juice.\n5 To serve, spoon the warm potatoes into a bowl. Place a fish on top or alongside skin-side up, and ladle over the rasam. Finish with a sprinkle of coriander, if using, and serve.",

Heat the oil in a large sauté pan, for which you have a lid, on a medium high heat. Add the onions and fry for 8–9 minutes, stirring a few times, until caramelised and soft. Reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic, harissa, paprika, chicken, 1 teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently, then add the passata and tomatoes. Pour over 350ml of water, bring to the boil, then simmer on a medium heat, covered, for 30 minutes, stirring every once in a while.\n2. Add the peppers and chocolate and continue to simmer for another 35–40 minutes, with the pan now uncovered, stirring frequently, until the sauce is getting thick and the chicken is falling apart. Remove from the heat and stir in the coriander. If you are serving the chicken as it is (as a stew without the batter), it’s ready to serve (or freeze, once it’s come to room temperature) at this stage. If you are making the corn topping, spoon the chicken into a ceramic baking dish – one with high sides that measures about 20 x 30cm – and set aside.\n3. Preheat the oven to 180°C fan.\n4. Pour the butter into a blender with the corn, milk, egg yolks and ¾ teaspoon salt. Blitz for a few seconds, to form a rough paste, then spoon into a large bowl.

Turn down the heat to medium-low and cook gently, stirring from time to time, so the rice doesn’t catch, for 30 minutes, then stir in the lime juice.\n4. Meanwhile, put the extra rice in a small frying pan on a medium-high heat, and toast, shaking the pan regularly, for five to seven minutes, until deeply browned and fragrant (you don’t want to burn it, but you do want to take it to the edge). Transfer to a spice grinder (or mortar), add the sugar and blitz (or grind) to a coarse powder (it needs some bite).\n5. When the rice pudding is almost ready, warm the remaining brown butter on a medium heat. Transfer the rice to a large, shallow bowl and pour over the butter. Sprinkle over two tablespoons of toasted rice and all the lime zest, and serve with the remaining rice and lime wedges.",

To make the shortbread, cream the butter and icing sugar until light and airy. Add the rest of the ingredients and mix until just combined. To prevent the pastry sticking to everything as you roll it out, place a sheet of greaseproof paper on your work surface, the pastry on top of that, then another sheet of greaseproof paper on top of the pastry. Press down with your palm to make a flattish circle, then roll out, still with the pastry between the two sheets of paper, until ½ cm thick. Transfer to a tray, remove the top sheet of greaseproof, and let it rest in the fridge for at least 20 minutes. Bake until golden (around 15-20 minutes). Once done, sprinkle with sugar and cut into 6cm-long fingers. Allow to cool.\nTo serve, whip both creams and the icing sugar until they begin to thicken. Pour a 1cm-deep layer on each jelly, as if it were champagne foam. Serve with the shortbread.",

First make the pumpkin spice mix. Put the cinnamon, ginger, cloves and nutmeg in a small bowl, spoon two teaspoons of the mix into a large bowl, add the flour, bicarb and cream of tartar, and set aside. Add the sugar to the remaining spice mix in the small bowl and set that aside, too.\n2. Now for the dough. Put the butter, sugar and half a teaspoon of salt in the bowl of a free-standing mixer with the paddle attachment in place. Mix on a medium-high speed for 10 minutes, until light and fluffy, then add the vanilla and egg, and continue mixing on a medium-high speed for one minute, until everything is well incorporated. With the motor running, add the flour mixture in three batches, scraping down the sides of the bowl as you go. Scrape the dough to the bottom of the bowl, making sure there are no bits stuck to the sides, then cover and refrigerate for an hour, until firm and rollable.\n3. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Divide the dough into 40g pieces and roll into firm balls: you should end up with 22. One at a time, roll the balls in the spice and sugar mixture, to coat well (if it doesn’t stick, warm the balls slightly in your hands first). Lay the balls on a large oven tray lined with greaseproof paper, spacing them out well apart – they will spread a lot while baking, so leave at least 5cm between each ball, and if need be use two trays and/or bake them in batches.\n4. Bake for nine minutes for a gooier cookie and up to 12 for a firmer one, then remove, transfer to a rack to cool and serve warm or at room temperature.",

Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over a medium-high heat until it begins to bubble. Turn the heat down to medium and cook, whisking occasionally to prevent it from burning. It should start to foam, at which point it’s almost ready: keep whisking until browned and smelling nutty. Immediately pour into a heat proof bowl to stop it cooking further (you should be left with 220g). Set aside to cool. You want it still liquid, so if it does solidify then melt it very gently once more and let cool slightly.\n2. Preheat the oven to 160C fan. Grease and line the sides of three, 23cm cake tins that have a removable base (springform cake tins will also work). You can also do this with 2 tins, saving a third of the batter to bake again once one of the cakes has cooled. We wouldn’t recommend doing this 3 times with 1 tin though, as the butter in the batter might start to solidify by the third go.\n3. In a large bowl whisk together the sugar, flour, baking powder and salt until combined and there are no lumps.\n4. In a separate large bowl, whisk together the eggs, oil, milk and vanilla until smooth. Pour this into the flour bowl and use a whisk and a folding motion to gently incorporate the wet ingredients into the dry. Once the batter is smooth and there are no lumps, pour in the cooled melted butter and the lemon\nzest and whisk just to combine (don’t over mix). Divide the batter evenly between the 3 cake tins, or alternatively add a third of the batter to each of the two tins (and reserve a third for a second bake). Bake for 22-25 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.\n5. While the cakes are in the oven, make the lemon syrup by adding the lemon and sugar to a small saucepan and placing over a high heat. Stir gently to dissolve the sugar then remove from the heat.\n6. Brush the tops of the still warm cakes with the warm lemon syrup (about 85ml per cake) then set aside to cool completely. If baking a third cake, set aside to cool for at least 20 minutes before gently releasing the cake from its tin. Repeat with the remaining batter so you have a total of 3 cakes.\n7. While the cakes are cooling, make the mascarpone cream by adding all the ingredients to a stand mixer, fitted with the whisk attachment, and beat on medium speed until smooth and you have soft to medium peaks, scraping the sides of the bowl as needed. Be sure to keep an eye on this, as you don’t want to over-whip the icing.\n8. When ready to assemble, place one of the cooled cakes on a cake stand. Using an off-set spatula or a palette knife, spread a little less than a third of the icing over the top of the cake. Evenly spoon over half the marmalade then crush a couple mini meringues with your hands and sprinkle this on top. Lastly, if using, sprinkle very lightly with some of the burnt lemon powder. Carefully place another cake on top. Repeat this process again before carefully topping with the last cake layer. Now spread the remaining icing on the top of the cake. Don’t worry about it being perfect, you can cover this up with the decorations! If getting ahead, refrigerate the cake at this point before decorating the top.\n9. To decorate the cake, artfully arrange some of the meringue kisses on top along with the dehydrated lemons and a small sprinkling of the burnt lemon powder. Cut into thin slivers and serve.\nDecorations (optional)\nMeringue kisses (makes over 100 kisses)\n120g egg whites\n1⁄2 tsp cream of tartar\n240g caster sugar\n3⁄4 tsp cornflour\n1/8 tsp baking powder\nMethod\n1. Preheat the oven to 90C fan. Line 2-3 large trays with parchment paper.\n2. Place the egg whites into a stand mixer, with the whisk attachment in place, and beat on medium-high speed until frothy. Add the cream of tartar and whisk until the mixture begins to stiffen slightly and the bubbles tighten. Meanwhile, combine the sugar, cornflour and baking powder in a medium bowl. When ready, and with the mixer on medium-high speed, use a dinner spoon to add in the sugar mixture a spoonful at a time, whisking until glossy and you have medium to stiff peaks.\n3. Transfer the meringue mixture into a piping bag fitted with a 13mm round nozzle (or a star shaped nozzle) and pipe small kisses, spaced a couple centimetres apart, onto the prepared trays. Bake for 90 minutes, or until nicely dried out, but not at all coloured. Set aside to cool completely. Store in an air-tight container for up to 2-3 weeks.\nDehydrated lemon slices\n2 lemons, sliced into thin 1⁄4 cm rounds, pips removed\nMethod\n1. Preheat the oven to 80C fan.\n2. Place the rounds onto a large, parchment-lined baking tray, arranging them so they’re not overlapping. Dehydrate in the oven for 3 hours, or until visibly\ndried and no longer carrying any moisture. Leave to cool completely then store in an airtight container. Dehydrated lemons can last for a very long time (years!) if stored correctly, as long as they’re completely void\nof any moisture as even the smallest amount will cause them to spoil with time.\nBurnt lemon powder\n2 lemons\nMethod\n1. Preheat the oven to 220C fan.\n2. Use a vegetable peeler or a small, sharp knife to remove the skin from the lemons, avoiding any pith. Place onto a small tray and bake on the top shelf of your oven for 15-20 minutes, or until very fragrant and completely charred and blackened. Set aside to cool then use a spice grinder or a small food processor to blitz into a fine powder. If using the latter, pass the powder through a sieve set over a bowl, to remove any larger pieces. Store in a jar in your cupboard and use to top sweet icings or creamy labneh.",

Repeat at a 90° angle to the other cuts to get square shaped incisions. Mix the fennel seeds, chilli flakes, cumin, black pepper and salt together, then rub them thoroughly all over the duck breasts with your hands. Place in a bowl, cover with cling film and leave to marinate for a few hours or in the fridge overnight.\nUsing a small, sharp knife, trim off 1cm from the top and bottom of each orange.

Make the labneh by putting the yoghurt and ½ teaspoon of salt into a bowl and mixing well to combine. Line a medium sieve with a piece of cheesecloth or a clean tea towel, with plenty of cloth hanging over the sides. Add the yoghurt, using the overhanging cloth to completely encase it, then set the sieve over a clean bowl and place a weight on top (a couple of tins will do). Refrigerate overnight. When the labneh is ready, discard the liquid collected and transfer the labneh to a clean bowl. You’ll make about 300g of labneh. Stir in the garlic and set aside.\n2. Preheat the oven to 220°C.\n3. Make the burnt lemon. Use a vegetable peeler to peel the lemons into long strips – don’t worry if you get some of the pith. You want 30g in total. Set aside a couple of strips and put the remainder on a small baking parchment-lined baking tray. Bake for 9–12 minutes, until completely dry and mostly blackened (they’ll shrivel up significantly). Finely grind with a pestle and mortar, then pass through a sieve, to catch any large pieces (discard these). Set the burnt lemon powder aside. Scrape away any pith from the reserved strips, and very finely julienne them. Set aside.\n4. Reset the oven to a high grill setting. Put the asparagus, oil, ¾ teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper on a large baking tray lined with foil, give everything a good mix, then arrange the spears so they’re not overlapping. Grill on the highest shelf for 8–10 minutes, until tender and nicely browned. Ovens can vary, so check at the 6-minute mark.\n5. Meanwhile, make the browned butter by first putting the butter into a small saucepan and placing it on a medium-high heat. Once melted, continue to cook for a further 3–4 minutes, swirling the pan occasionally, until nicely browned and smelling nutty. Add the thyme sprigs (careful, the fat will spit!), then stir in the brown sugar, ¾ teaspoon of the burnt lemon powder and ⅛ teaspoon of salt. Set aside to cool down slightly, about 5 minutes.\n6. While the butter is cooling, segment one of the peeled lemons. Use a small sharp knife to trim away any excess pith, then cut between the membranes to release the segments and roughly chop each into 3–4 pieces. Juice the remaining lemon to give you 4 teaspoons of juice. Add the juice and all the segments to the browned butter mixture.\n7. Spread the labneh out on a platter or plate, and top with the asparagus, so that the spears are all facing in the same direction. Pour over the browned butter, then scatter over the picked thyme. Lastly, sprinkle with ¼ teaspoon of the burnt lemon powder and the lemon strips.",
